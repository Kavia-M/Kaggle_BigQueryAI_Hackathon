PRODUCTS
Deere & Company (Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively called John Deere) have operations which are categorized into five business segments.
The Company's worldwide AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT segment manufactures and distributes a full range of equipment used in commercial farming -- including tractors; tillage, soil preparation, planting and harvesting machinery; and crop handling equipment.
The Company's worldwide INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT segment manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines used in construction, earthmoving and forestry -- including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; scrapers; motor graders; excavators; and log skidders. This segment also includes the manufacture and distribution of engines and drivetrain components for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market.
The Company's worldwide LAWN AND GROUNDS CARE EQUIPMENT segment manufactures and distributes equipment for commercial and residential uses -- including small tractors for lawn, garden and utility purposes; riding and walk- behind mowers; golf course equipment; utility transport vehicles; snowblowers; and other outdoor power products.
The products produced by the equipment segments are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks.
The Company's CREDIT segment, which operates in the United States and Canada, purchases and finances retail notes from John Deere's equipment sales branches in the United States and Canada. The notes are acquired by the sales branches through John Deere retail dealers and originate in connection with retail sales by dealers of new John Deere equipment and used equipment. The credit segment also purchases and finances retail notes unrelated to John Deere equipment, representing primarily recreational vehicle and recreational marine product notes acquired from independent dealers of that equipment (recreational product retail notes). The credit subsidiaries also lease John Deere equipment to retail customers, finance and service unsecured revolving charge accounts acquired from merchants in the agricultural, lawn and grounds care and marine retail markets, and provide wholesale financing for recreational vehicles and John Deere engine inventories held by dealers of those products.
The Company's INSURANCE AND HEALTH care segment issues policies in the United States and Canada primarily for: a general line of property and casualty insurance to John Deere and non-Deere dealers and to the general public; group life and group accident and health insurance for employees of participating John Deere dealers; group life and group accident and health insurance for employees of John Deere; life and annuity products to the general public and credit physical damage insurance in connection with certain retail sales of John Deere products financed by the credit subsidiaries. This segment also provides health management programs and related administrative services in the United States to corporate customers and employees of John Deere.
The Company's worldwide agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment operations and subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as the ""Equipment Operations."" The Company's credit, insurance and health care subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as ""Financial Services.""
The Company believes that its worldwide sales of agricultural equipment during recent years have been greater than those of any other business enterprise. It also believes that John Deere is an important provider of most of the types of industrial equipment that it markets, and a leader in some size ranges. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer of lawn and garden tractors and provides the broadest line of grounds care equipment in North America. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS
North American agricultural economic conditions in 1993 were generally more favorable than in 1992. Although flooding and excessively wet conditions in certain areas of the Midwest and drought conditions in parts of the Southeast resulted in an estimated 31 percent decrease in corn production and a 16 percent decline in soybean production in 1993, United States farm net cash income is expected to achieve a record level in 1993. The lower production caused grain prices to rise above 1992 levels. Livestock producers enjoyed favorable prices and profit margins during 1993 and farmers boosted their cash flow by selling inventories accumulated from record corn and soybean yields in 1992. Additionally, direct government payments to farmers are expected to increase in 1993, aiding farmers most heavily impacted by this year's flooding. Uncertainties over the passage of a new investment tax credit were resolved in 1993 as the anticipated tax credit was not included in the final tax legislation. Consequently, many United States farmers who had delayed making purchases in 1992 bought equipment this year. Sales in Canada were boosted by a special 13 month investment tax credit in effect from December 1992 to December 1993. As a result of these developments, North American retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment were considerably higher in 1993 compared with last year.
The North American general economy continued its slow expansion in 1993. In the United States, housing starts increased about five percent during the year with second-half strength overcoming a very sluggish first half. Real public construction was up slightly from the previous year's level while non-residential construction was flat. However, the cumulative effects of the rebound in economic activity were felt in 1993, as housing starts were up more than 25 percent from their 1991 level and real public construction was nine percent larger. Consequently, North American retail sales of industrial and construction machinery for both the industry and John Deere rose significantly in 1993.
Consumer spending for durable goods rose briskly in 1993, and North American retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment increased significantly. Sales were also supported by favorable moisture conditions over most areas throughout the prime selling season. However, dry conditions did emerge in portions of the Southeast and Northeast which impeded some late season buying activity.
Industry retail sales of agricultural equipment in overseas markets in general remained relatively weak during 1993. However, overseas retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment were higher in 1993 than in 1992, reflecting good acceptance of the Company's new tractors and combines. Despite recessionary conditions prevailing in most European markets and in Japan, overseas retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment continued to expand in 1993. Overseas industrial and construction equipment markets were relatively flat in 1993 compared with 1992.
Acquisitions of receivables and leases by the Company's credit subsidiaries were somewhat higher in 1993 compared with last year due primarily to growth in revolving charge accounts, leases and wholesale receivables. Although retail sales of John Deere equipment were higher in 1993, acquisitions of John Deere retail notes were down slightly compared with last year reflecting a higher level of cash purchases by John Deere customers and a more competitive financing environment, particularly during the latter part of 1993. Acquisitions of recreational product retail notes were substantially lower in 1993 due mainly to a very competitive financing market. Although relatively soft market conditions continued during 1993 in the property/casualty insurance
industry, John Deere's insurance premium volumes increased in 1993 over 1992. Health care premium volumes were considerably higher in 1993 reflecting continued growth in John Deere's health care operations.
Worldwide income in 1993 was $286 million or $3.70 per share before the effects of special items (accounting changes, restructuring charges and the new United States income tax law), compared with net income of $37 million or $.49 per share in 1992. However, 1993 reported results were affected by the special items described below. After the effects of the restructuring charges, the incremental expense from the accounting changes and the tax rate change, income in 1993 was $184 million or $2.39 per share. The Company incurred a worldwide net loss in 1993 of $921 million or $11.91 per share after all of the special items including the cumulative effect of the accounting changes. Additional financial information regarding each of the Company's business segments over the past three years is presented on pages 34 and 35.
During the second quarter of 1993, the Company announced and initiated plans to downsize and rationalize its European operations. This resulted in a second quarter provision for restructuring charges of $80 million after income taxes or $1.03 per share ($107 million before income taxes), representing costs of employment reductions to be implemented during 1993 and the next few years.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, effective November 1, 1992, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and FASB Statement No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. These standards generally require the accrual of these benefits, which are primarily retiree health care and life insurance benefits, during the employees' years of active service. The Company elected to recognize the cumulative effect of these accounting changes as a one-time charge to earnings. The aggregate cumulative effect of adopting the new standards as of November 1, 1992 was a non-cash charge of $1,105 million after income taxes or $14.30 per share ($1,728 million before income taxes). Additionally, the adoption of these standards resulted in an incremental non-cash after-tax increase in 1993 postretirement and postemployment benefits expense of $38 million or $.49 per share ($60 million before income taxes). The incremental postretirement and postemployment benefits expense relating to the Financial Services subsidiaries was immaterial. Additional information is presented on pages 36 and 37 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which enacted an increase in the United States federal statutory income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent effective January 1, 1993, was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 1993. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, income taxes relating to previously reported United States taxable income were recalculated and the United States deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date were revalued during the fourth quarter of 1993 using the new tax rate of 35 percent. This resulted in a credit of $16 million or $.21 per share to the provision for income taxes. This tax rate change had an immaterial effect on the Financial Services subsidiaries. Additional information is presented on page 39 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company's worldwide Equipment Operations, which exclude income from the credit, insurance and health care operations, had income of $114 million in 1993 before the effects of the previously mentioned special items, compared with a net loss of $107 million in 1992. The improved operating results for 1993 were attributable to the Company's North American equipment operations. Sales and production volumes in North America were higher this year in response to increased retail demand, and price realization improved in all of the Company's North American equipment businesses compared with 1992 as sales incentive cost levels were significantly lower. Additionally, North American productivity continued to improve during 1993. Including the incremental effect of the accounting changes, the restructuring charges and the tax rate change, the worldwide Equipment Operations' net income was $13 million in 1993. The Equipment Operations incurred a net loss of $1,085 million in 1993 after all of the special items including the cumulative effect of the accounting changes. Income of the Company's Financial Services subsidiaries before the cumulative effect of the accounting changes totaled $164 million in 1993 while net income after the accounting changes was $157 million, compared with $138 million last year.
Worldwide net sales and revenues, which include net sales of equipment and revenues from the credit, insurance and health care operations, increased 11 percent to $7,754 million in 1993 compared with net sales and revenues of $6,961 million in 1992. Worldwide net sales of equipment to dealers were $6,479 million in 1993, an increase of 13 percent from sales of $5,723 million last year. The physical volume of the Company's worldwide sales to dealers increased approximately nine percent in 1993. Worldwide production tonnage of all John Deere products in 1993 was 11 percent higher than last year. For further discussion of results of operations, see the information under the caption ""Management's Discussion and Analysis"" on pages 24-35.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT
Sales of agricultural equipment, particularly in the United States and Canada, are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields and government payments. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, levels of interest rates, agricultural trends and the levels of costs associated with farming. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers.
A substantial part of new agricultural equipment sales is for replacement of equipment that is old or is less efficient than newer equipment, or both. When the farm economy is depressed, farmers tend to postpone the replacement of their existing equipment. When conditions improve, sales are stimulated by demand for replacement equipment. During the 1990's, there has been a continuation of the trend toward minimum tillage agriculture. Minimum tillage agriculture reduces soil erosion but increases the use of chemical herbicides and pesticides.
Several governmental initiatives have recently been approved that may hold long-term promise for agricultural markets. The U.S., Canada, and Mexico have implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which reduces internal trade restrictions between the three countries. For some commodities and products, free trade commenced January 1, 1994. For other products which are more sensitive economically and politically, free trade will be achieved gradually over a 15 year period. U.S. corn exports to Mexico fall into this second category. The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) also was successfully concluded in 1993. This agreement promises to reduce agricultural export subsidies over a period of years and grant market access for many products that were previously restricted. It is the Company's belief that U.S. and Canadian farmers possess comparative advantages in the production of certain agricultural products and may benefit from the eventual implementation of this agreement. This treaty is expected to take effect July 1, 1995. Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agreed in December 1993 that 30 percent of the fuel used in metropolitan areas not reaching nationally established air quality guidelines should come from renewable fuel sources. While final approval has not been reached, it is widely believed that corn producers will benefit from EPA's action.
Since the early 1980s, farmers have experienced cost/price pressures which have caused them to be more concerned with cost control and maximum productivity. The John Deere agricultural equipment sold in this environment is high-powered, versatile and technologically sophisticated. It is built to exacting design, materials and performance specifications for rugged usage and exposure to adverse weather conditions.
Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of total United States farm output; 28 percent of United States farms accounted for 90 percent of agricultural produce sales in 1987 (the latest year for which data are available).(1) The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the Equipment Operations' total agricultural equipment sales in the United States is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower and self-propelled combines. During late 1992, John Deere introduced three new tractor lines: the 5000, 6000 and 7000 series
tractors selling in the 40 to 150 PTO horsepower categories. These tractors represented important changes to John Deere's product offerings. The 6000 and 7000 series tractors have many new design features including modular configuration permitting lower cost updates to respond to changing customer needs. The 5000 series tractors are manufactured in the United States and replace tractors formerly sourced from Germany.
In the United States, farm commodity prices and farm income are heavily influenced by international supply and demand conditions for food and fiber products. In general, declining international stock levels boost farm commodity prices and incomes, while rising stock levels tend to depress prices and incomes. In 1993, world production of wheat and coarse grains (corn, oats, barley and sorghum) fell from the levels achieved in 1992. Production decreases were most notable in the United States, the former Soviet Union and the European Union (formerly the European Economic Community). The ending worldwide stocks of wheat are now expected by the United States Department of Agriculture (""USDA"") to decrease slightly to 139.1 million metric tons (""MMT"") at the end of the 1993/94 marketing year compared with 141.3 MMT one year earlier. The 139.1 MMT stock level will represent about 25 percent of annual world consumption, a stock-to-usage ratio that is well below the 33 - 34 percent range that prevailed in the mid-1980s. This ratio stood at 23 percent in 1989/90 and has been 25 or 26 percent for the past three years. Ending stocks of coarse grains are expected by the USDA to fall to 114.3 MMT at the end of the 1993/94 marketing year as consumption is expected to exceed production. This would represent 14 percent of annual world consumption. This ratio is down significantly from 1992/93 (when it was 18%), and represents the lowest level of carryover relative to usage since 1973/74.(2)
For 1994, USDA has announced zero annual acreage reduction programs for all crops except cotton, which was raised from 7.5 percent in 1993 to 11 percent in 1994. Total acreage planted in 1994 is expected to rise about 9 million acres from 1993 levels. United States market share of commodity sales in world markets rose in the first three years (1986-1988) following passage of the 1985 farm bill. This resulted partly from a weaker dollar in relation to other currencies, and partly from more competitive United States commodity prices stemming from the 1985 farm bill. Thereafter, as United States carryover stocks declined and production was tempered by governmental acreage reduction programs and drought in various years, United States market shares have generally declined. Market share for United States wheat has been adversely affected by higher Canadian and European production.
Direct government payments to farmers were increased significantly by the 1985 farm bill. During 1977-82, government payments represented less than two percent of United States farm cash receipts. This percentage rose to 10.5 percent in 1987 and, although still high compared to 1977-82, declined to 4.5 percent in 1991. These direct government payments, combined with lower production costs incurred by farmers and higher livestock and commodity prices, resulted in record levels of net cash income to United States farmers from 1987 to 1990. The 1990 farm bill extended the basic features of the 1985 farm bill through 1995 with two notable exceptions: (1) target prices were frozen at their 1990 levels rather than declining two to three percent annually, and (2) a ""triple base"" feature was incorporated into the new legislation. This feature restricts deficiency payments to 85 percent of the base traditionally paid and is expected to reduce future government outlays. Government payments are forecasted to increase to 7.0 percent of United States farm cash receipts for 1993 compared to 5.0 percent in 1992, and farm net cash income is estimated to have reached a record level in 1993.(3) The 1990 farm bill is scheduled to remain in effect through the crops grown in 1995.
Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated months in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year. The Equipment Operations incur substantial seasonal indebtedness with related interest expense to finance production and inventory of equipment, and to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. The Equipment Operations often encourage retail sales by waiving retail finance charges during off-season periods or in other sales promotions. Sales promotions and price concessions, including waiver and reduction of finance charges, were significantly lower in 1992 and 1993 compared with extensive amounts during recent prior years.
An important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Because of industry conditions, especially consolidation among large integrated competitors, the competitive environment is undergoing important changes, and the importance of short-line and specialty manufacturers, as well as foreign suppliers, may continue to increase in the future.
Outside the United States, price stabilization programs conducted by national governments or groups of national governments, such as the European Union, tend to exert substantial influence upon commodity prices and agricultural activity, insulating their agricultural sectors from changes in world market conditions and restricting imports from the United States and elsewhere. In Western Europe, the cost of such programs, international disputes with exporting nations, and international negotiations such as GATT have caused the European Union to alter and modify its Common Agricultural Policy over time. These changes have tended to lower real farm income and restrict planted and harvested acreage. As a result, agricultural machinery sales have fallen substantially in Western Europe in the last decade. Inflation, slow economic growth, changes in currency relationships and price controls have been prevalent in many of the countries in which the Equipment Operations compete outside the United States, Canada and Europe.
In addition to the agricultural equipment manufactured by the Equipment Operations, a number of products are purchased from other manufacturers for resale by John Deere, including four models of small utility tractors sourced from a Japanese manufacturer. These tractors are marketed primarily in the United States and Canada.
INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT
The industrial equipment industry is broadly defined as including construction, earthmoving and forestry equipment, as well as some materials handling equipment, cranes, off-highway trucks and a variety of machines for specialized industrial applications, including uses in the mining industry. The Equipment Operations provide types and sizes of equipment that compete for approximately two-thirds of the estimated total United States market for all types and sizes of industrial equipment (other than the market for cranes and specialized mining equipment). Retail sales of John Deere industrial equipment are influenced by prevailing levels of residential, industrial and public construction and the condition of the forest products industry. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions and the level of interest rates.
United States housing starts are forecasted to have been 1.26 million units in 1993, about 4 percent higher than 1992, and 25 percent higher than 1991. Nonresidential and public construction in the United States are both expected to be unchanged in 1993 as compared to 1992, but together were up about nine percent from 1991 activity. Environmental and ecological issues slowed logging activities in various parts of the United States in 1993, while late year housing activity boosted the demand for lumber products and lumber prices rose significantly as a result of these developments. North American industry retail sales of industrial and construction machinery rose significantly in 1993 compared with 1992.
John Deere industrial equipment falls into three broad categories: utility tractors and smaller earthmoving equipment, medium capacity construction and earthmoving equipment, and forestry machines. The Equipment Operations' industrial equipment business began in the late 1940s with wheel and crawler tractors of a size and horsepower range similar to agricultural tractors, utilizing common components. Through the years, the Equipment Operations substantially increased production capacity for industrial equipment, adding to the line larger machines such as crawler loaders and dozers, log skidders, motor graders, hydraulic excavators and four-wheel-drive loaders. These products incorporate technology and many major components similar to those used in agricultural equipment, including diesel engines, transmissions and sophisticated hydraulics and electronics.
The Company and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Inc. of Japan have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators in the United States and for the distribution of excavators primarily in North, Central and South America. The Company also has supply agreements with Hitachi under which a broad range of industrial products manufactured by the Company in the United States, including four-wheel-drive loaders, are distributed by Hitachi in Japan and other Far East markets. In addition, Hitachi is manufacturing certain models of four-wheel-drive loaders for distribution by John Deere primarily in North, Central and South America.
The Equipment Operations manufacture and distribute diesel engines and drivetrain components both for use in John Deere products and for sale to other original equipment manufacturers (OEM).
LAWN AND GROUNDS CARE EQUIPMENT
The line of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment includes rear-engine riding mowers, front-engine lawn tractors and suburban tractors, lawn and garden tractors, small diesel tractors, compact utility tractors, front mowers, small utility transport vehicles, and a broad line of associated implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and many other residential, commercial, golf and sports turf care applications. The product line also includes walk-behind mowers, snow throwers and other outdoor power products. Retail sales of lawn and grounds care products are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions.
Even though the recovery of the general economy has been slow, the length of the upturn, the gradual improvement in housing starts and sales of existing homes, and generally favorable weather conditions stimulated purchases of lawn and grounds care equipment in 1993. Retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment increased significantly in 1993.
ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH
John Deere makes large expenditures for engineering and research to improve the quality and performance of its products, and to develop new products. Such expenditures were $270 million, or four percent of net equipment sales in 1993, and $288 million in 1992.
MANUFACTURING
MANUFACTURING PLANTS. In the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations own and operate 15 factory locations, which contain approximately 29.5 million square feet of floor space. Six of the factories are devoted primarily to the manufacture of agricultural equipment, two to industrial equipment, one to engines, one to hydraulics and power train components, one to gray iron and nodular castings, three to lawn and grounds care equipment, and one to power train components manufactured mostly for OEM markets. The Equipment Operations own and operate tractor factories in Germany, Spain and Argentina; agricultural equipment factories in France, Germany and South Africa; and an engine factory in France. These overseas factories contain approximately 6.1 million square feet of floor space. The Equipment Operations also have financial interests in a combine manufacturer in Brazil, in a tractor and implement manufacturer in Mexico, in a lawn and grounds care equipment manufacturer in Germany and the Netherlands, and in a joint venture to build industrial excavators in the United States.
John Deere's facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition and are suitable for their present purposes. These facilities together with planned capital expenditures are expected to meet John Deere's needs in the foreseeable future.
The Equipment Operations manufacture many of the components included in their products. The principle raw materials required for the manufacture of their products are purchased from numerous suppliers. The Company
believes that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for its needs for the foreseeable future. Although the Equipment Operations depend upon outside sources of supply for a substantial amount of components, manufacturing operations are extensively integrated. Similar or common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for industrial, agricultural and lawn and grounds care equipment.
Although production levels in 1993 were ten percent higher than in 1992, production continues to be well below capacity levels. The Equipment Operations' manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation, so that manufacturing processes can remain viable at relatively low production levels and can be flexible enough to accommodate many of the product design changes required to meet market requirements.
In order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the Equipment Operations continue to pursue improvements in manufacturing processes. Manufacturing activities judged not competitively advantageous for the Equipment Operations on a long-term basis are being shifted to outside suppliers, while many of those manufacturing activities that do offer long-term competitive advantages are being restructured. Improvements include the creation of flow-through manufacturing cells which reduce costs and inventories, increase quality and require less space, and the establishment of flexible assembly lines which can handle a wider range of product mix and deliver products at the times when dealers and customers demand them. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through product design, the introduction of advanced manufacturing technology and improvements in organizational structure. The Equipment Operations are also pursuing the sale to other companies of selected parts and components which can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Equipment Operations' capital expenditures were $196 million in 1993 compared with $269 million in 1992 and $295 million in 1991. Provisions for depreciation applicable to the Equipment Operations' property, plant and equipment during these years were $222 million, $213 million and $186 million, respectively. The Equipment Operations' capital expenditures for 1994 are currently estimated to approximate $230 million. As in recent years, the 1994 expenditures will be primarily associated with new product and operations improvement programs. The future level of capital expenditures will depend on business conditions.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
John Deere owns a significant number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents and licenses are generally important to its operations, but does not consider that any patent or license or group of them is of material importance in relation to John Deere's business.
MARKETING
In the United States and Canada, the Equipment Operations distribute equipment and service parts through six agricultural equipment sales branches, one industrial equipment sales and administration office and one lawn and grounds care equipment sales and administration office (collectively called sales branches). In addition, the Equipment Operations operate a centralized parts distribution warehouse in coordination with several regional parts depots in the United States and Canada.
The sales branches in the United States and Canada market John Deere products to approximately 3,250 retail dealers, all of which are independently owned except for one retail store owned and operated by the Company. Of these dealers, approximately 1,550 sell agricultural equipment, 382 sell industrial equipment, and 26 sell both agricultural and industrial equipment. Smaller industrial equipment is sold by nearly all of the industrial equipment dealers. Larger industrial equipment, forestry equipment and a line of light industrial equipment are
sold by most of them. Lawn and grounds care equipment is sold by most John Deere agricultural equipment dealers, a few industrial equipment dealers, and about 1,300 lawn and grounds care equipment dealers, many of whom also handle competitive brands and dissimilar lines of products.
Outside North America, John Deere agricultural equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 110 countries by sales branches located in six European countries, South Africa, Argentina and Australia, by export sales branches in Europe and the United States, and by associated companies in Mexico and Brazil. Lawn and grounds care equipment sales overseas occur primarily in Europe and Australia. Outside North America, industrial equipment is sold primarily by an export sales branch located in the United States.
WHOLESALE FINANCING
The Equipment Operations provide wholesale financing to dealers in the United States for extended periods, to enable dealers to carry representative inventories of equipment and to encourage the purchase of goods by dealers in advance of seasonal retail demand. Down payments are not required, and interest is not charged for a substantial part of the period for which the inventories are financed. A security interest is retained in dealers' inventories, and periodic physical checks are made of dealers' inventories. Generally, terms to dealers require payments as the equipment which secures the indebtedness is sold to retail customers. Variable market rates of interest are charged on balances outstanding after certain interest-free periods, which currently are 6 to 9 months for agricultural tractors, 6 months for industrial equipment, and from 6 to 24 months for most other equipment. Financing is also provided to dealers on used equipment accepted in trade, on repossessed equipment, and on approved equipment from other manufacturers. A security interest is obtained in such equipment. Equipment dealer defaults incurred in recent years by John Deere have not been significant.
In Canada, John Deere products (other than service parts and lawn and grounds care equipment) in the possession of dealers are inventories of the Equipment Operations that are consigned to the dealers. Dealers are required to make deposits on consigned equipment remaining unsold after specified periods.
Sales to overseas dealers are made by the Equipment Operations' overseas and export sales branches and are, for the most part, financed by John Deere in a manner similar to that provided for sales to dealers in the United States and Canada, although maturities tend to be shorter and a security interest is not always retained in the equipment sold.
Receivables from dealers, which largely represent dealer inventories, were $2.8 billion at October 31, 1993 compared with $2.9 billion at October 31, 1992 and $3.0 billion at October 31, 1991. At those dates, the ratios of worldwide net dealer receivables to fiscal year net sales were 43 percent, 51 percent and 51 percent, respectively. The highest month-end balance of such receivables during each of the past two fiscal years was $3.1 billion at April 30, 1993 and $3.3 billion at April 30, 1992.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
CREDIT OPERATIONS
UNITED STATES AND CANADA. In the United States and Canada, the Company's credit subsidiaries finance retail sales of John Deere agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment, used equipment accepted by dealers in trade, and a significant amount of equipment of other manufacturers. John Deere retail installment loan (and some sale) contracts (collectively called retail notes) are acquired by the sales branches through John Deere retail dealers. Criteria for acceptance of retail notes are agreed upon between the sales branches and the Company's credit subsidiaries in the United States and Canada, John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) and John Deere Finance Limited, (collectively referred to as Credit Companies). A subsidiary of
the Capital Corporation leases John Deere agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment to United States retail customers.
The credit subsidiaries also finance recreational products, primarily recreational vehicle and recreational marine product retail notes acquired from independent dealers of that equipment. The United States credit subsidiary also finances and services unsecured revolving charge accounts acquired from retail merchants in the agricultural, lawn and grounds care and marine retail markets and, additionally, provides wholesale financing for recreational vehicles and John Deere engine inventories held by dealers of those products. The credit subsidiaries intend to continue to seek additional volumes and types of non-Deere financing with the objective of broadening their base of business and increasing their autonomy.
All of the retail notes acquired by the sales branches have been immediately sold by them to the Credit Companies. The Equipment Operations have been the Credit Companies' major source of business, and the Credit Companies have been the sole vehicles for retail financing by the Equipment Operations. In many cases, retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization.
The Credit Companies' terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items purchased through unsecured revolving charge accounts) provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The Credit Companies' guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions, are generally not less than 20 percent on agricultural and industrial equipment, 10 percent on lawn and grounds care equipment used for personal use and 20 percent for recreational vehicles and marine products. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. At the time retail notes are accepted, the Equipment Operations compensate the Credit Companies in an amount permitting them to earn approximately the normal net finance charge on the retail notes or leases for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the Equipment Operations.
Retail leases are offered to equipment users in the United States by John Deere retail dealers on behalf of the Capital Corporation. A small number of leases executed between dealers and units of local government are subsequently assigned to the sales branches, and are in turn offered to and accepted by the Capital Corporation. Leases are usually written for periods of one to six years, and in some cases contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through a Canadian subsidiary.
The Company has expressed an intention of conducting its business with the Capital Corporation on such terms that the Capital Corporation's consolidated ratio of earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges for each fiscal quarter will not be less than 1.05 to 1. For 1993, the consolidated ratio of the Capital Corporation was 1.99 to 1 (excluding the effect of the accounting changes). This arrangement is not intended to make the Company responsible for payment of the obligations of the Capital Corporation. Additional information on the Credit Companies appears under the caption ""Credit Operations"" on pages 30 and 31.
OVERSEAS. Retail sales and financing outside of the United States and Canada are affected by a diversity of customs and regulations. The Equipment Operations retain only a minor part of the obligations arising from retail sales of their products overseas.
INSURANCE AND HEALTH CARE
The Company's insurance subsidiaries consist of John Deere Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries in the United States, and John Deere Insurance Company of Canada. The Insurance Group is made up of a Property/Casualty Division and a Life Division. The Property/Casualty Division insures over 4,300 dealership organizations in the United States. This program provides commercial insurance for agricultural/ industrial
equipment, auto, recreational vehicle and boat dealerships. In addition, the Property/Casualty Division insures long haul trucking operations and currently insures approximately 13,000 trucks. Other specialty insurance programs include insurance on equipment utilized in forestry, construction and agricultural operations. The Group's involvement in reinsurance takes the form of a long-term business relationship with Re Capital Reinsurance Corporation as well as the ownership of approximately 44% of the outstanding shares of Re Capital Corporation, its parent company. The Life Division had nearly $6 billion of life insurance in force at October 31, 1993. Marketing efforts are focused on providing life and health insurance coverages to various commercial markets and to individuals, nationally.
In 1985, the Company formed John Deere Health Care, Inc. to more fully utilize the Company's expertise in the field of health care, which was developed from efforts to control its own health care costs. John Deere Health Care, Inc. currently provides health management programs and related administrative services, either directly or through its health maintenance organization subsidiaries. Heritage National Healthplan and John Deere Family Healthplan, for companies located in Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Tennessee. At October 31, 1993, 234,931 individuals were enrolled in these programs, of which 69,352 were John Deere employees, retirees and their dependents.
For additional financial information on insurance and health care operations, see the material under the caption ""Insurance and Health Care Operations"" on pages 31 and 32.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
In 1990, certain Clean Air Act Amendments were adopted by Congress which require the Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") to study emissions from off-road engines and equipment, including virtually all of the equipment manufactured by the Company. If the EPA determines such emissions contribute to air quality problems, the EPA is required to promulgate regulations containing standards applicable to such emissions. The EPA may promulgate such regulations sometime during 1994. Although at this time management cannot assess the impact that such regulations (if promulgated) would have upon the Company, management does not believe that it is likely to be material.
The Company has been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP), in conjunction with other parties, in certain government actions associated with hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, the Company has been and will be required to pay a portion of the costs of evaluation and cleanup of these sites. Management does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or operating results of the Company.
EMPLOYEES
At October 31, 1993, John Deere had 33,070 employees, including 24,942 employees in the United States and Canada. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 95 percent of John Deere's United States employees. Most of the Company's United States production and maintenance employees are covered by a contract with the United Automobile Workers with an expiration date of October 1, 1994.
The majority of employees at John Deere facilities overseas are also represented by unions.

ITEM 3.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability and retail credit matters. The Company and certain subsidiaries of the Capital Corporation are currently involved in legal actions relating to alleged violations of certain technical provisions of Texas consumer credit statutes in connection with John Deere Company's financing of the retail purchase of recreational vehicles and boats in that state. These actions include: a class action brought by Russell Durrett individually and on behalf of others against John Deere Company (filed in state court on February 19, 1992 and removed on February 26, 1992 to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division), which case was certified as a class action by the court on November 6, 1992; and a class action titled DEERE CREDIT, INC. V. SHIRLEY Y. MORGAN, ET AL., originally filed on February 20 1992 and certified in the 281st Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, on October 12, 1993 for all persons who opt out of the federal class action. The Company and the Capital Corporation subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses and intend to defend the actions vigorously. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these unresolved legal actions and the amounts of claimed damages and penalties are large, the Company believes that these unresolved legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991 (UNAUDITED) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUSINESS AND SEGMENT DESCRIPTION
The company's operations are categorized into five business segments described below.
The company's worldwide agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full range of equipment used in commercial farming - including tractors; tillage, soil preparation, planting and harvesting machinery; and crop handling equipment.
The company's worldwide industrial equipment segment manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines used in construction, earthmoving and forestry - including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive loaders; scrapers; motor graders; excavators; and log skidders. This segment also includes the manufacture and distribution of engines and drivetrain components for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market.
The company's worldwide lawn and grounds care equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment for commercial and residential uses - including small tractors for lawn, garden and utility purposes; riding and walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment; utility transport vehicles; snowblowers; and other outdoor power products.
The products produced by the equipment segments are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks.
The company's credit segment, which operates in the United States and Canada, purchases and finances retail notes from John Deere's equipment sales branches in the United States and Canada. The notes are acquired by the sales branches through John Deere retail dealers and originate in connection with retail sales by dealers of new John Deere equipment and used equipment. The credit segment also purchases and finances retail notes unrelated to John Deere equipment, representing primarily recreational vehicle and recreational marine product notes acquired from independent dealers of that equipment (recreational product retail notes). The credit subsidiaries also lease John Deere equipment to retail customers, finance and service unsecured revolving charge accounts acquired from merchants in the agricultural, lawn and grounds care and marine retail markets, and provide wholesale financing for recreational vehicles and John Deere engine inventories held by dealers of those products.
The company's insurance and health care segment issues policies in the United States and Canada primarily for: a general line of property and casualty insurance to John Deere and non-Deere dealers and to the general public; group life and group accident and health insurance for employees of participating John Deere dealers; group life and group accident and health insurance for employees of the company; life and annuity products to the general public and credit physical damage insurance in connection with certain retail sales of John Deere products financed by the credit subsidiaries. This segment also provides health management programs and related administrative services in the United States to corporate customers and employees of Deere & Company.
Deere & Company's consolidated financial statements result from consolidation of the company's agricultural equipment, industrial equipment and lawn and grounds care equipment businesses with its Financial Services businesses (credit, insurance and health care). The consolidation procedure is explained on page 36 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The notes explain how the terms ""Equipment Operations"", ""Financial Services"" and ""Consolidated"" are used in this report to help readers understand the data presented. These terms are used in Management's Discussion and Analysis for clarification or emphasis.
Net sales of service parts and accessories, which are included in the previous totals, amounted to $1,358 million in 1993, $1,260 million in 1992 and $1,243 million in 1991.
1993 COMPARED WITH 1992 (UNAUDITED) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKET CONDITIONS
North American agricultural economic conditions were generally more favorable than in 1992. Although flooding and excessively wet conditions in certain areas of the Midwest and drought conditions in parts of the Southeast resulted in an estimated 31 percent
decrease in corn production and a 16 percent decline in soybean production in 1993, United States farm cash income is expected to achieve a record level in 1993. The lower production caused grain prices to rise above 1992 levels. Livestock producers enjoyed favorable prices and profit margins during 1993 and farmers boosted their cash flow by selling inventories accumulated from record corn and soybean yields in 1992. Additionally, direct government payments to farmers are expected to increase in 1993, aiding farmers most heavily impacted by this year's flooding. Uncertainties over the passage of a new investment tax credit were resolved in 1993 as the anticipated tax credit was not included in the final tax legislation. Consequently, many United States farmers who had delayed making purchases in 1992 bought equipment this year. Sales in Canada were boosted by a special 13-month investment tax credit in effect from December 1992 to December 1993. As a result of these developments, North American retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment were considerably higher in 1993 compared with last year.
The North American general economy continued its slow expansion in 1993. In the United States, housing starts increased about five percent during the year with second-half strength overcoming a very sluggish first half. Real public construction was up slightly from the previous year's level while nonresidential construction was flat. However, the cumulative effects of the rebound in economic activity were felt in 1993, as housing starts were up more than 25 percent from their 1991 level and real public construction was nine percent larger. Consequently, North American retail sales of industrial and construction machinery for both the industry and John Deere rose significantly in 1993.
Consumer spending for durable goods rose briskly in 1993, and North American retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment increased significantly. Sales were also supported by favorable moisture conditions over most areas throughout the prime selling season. However, dry conditions did emerge in portions of the Southeast and Northeast which impeded some late season buying activity.
Industry retail sales of agricultural equipment in overseas markets in general remained relatively weak during 1993. However, overseas retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment were higher in 1993 than in 1992, reflecting good acceptance of the company's new tractors and combines. Despite recessionary conditions prevailing in most European markets and in Japan, overseas retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment continued to expand in 1993. Overseas industrial and construction equipment markets were relatively flat in 1993 compared with 1992.
Acquisitions of receivables and leases by the company's credit subsidiaries were somewhat higher in 1993 compared with last year due primarily to growth in revolving charge accounts, leases and wholesale receivables. Although retail sales of John Deere equipment were higher in 1993, acquisitions of John Deere retail notes were down slightly compared with last year reflecting a higher level of cash purchases by John Deere customers and a more competitive financing environment, particularly during the latter part of 1993. Acquisitions of recreational product retail notes were significantly lower in 1993 due mainly to a very competitive financing market. Although relatively soft market conditions continued during 1993 in the property/casualty insurance industry, John Deere's insurance premium volumes increased in 1993 over 1992. Health care premium volumes were considerably higher in 1993 reflecting continued growth in the company's health care operations.
OPERATING RESULTS
Deere & Company's operating results before the effects of special items (restructuring charges, changes in accounting standards and tax law changes) improved significantly in 1993 as a result of substantial improvement in the company's North American equipment operations and continued strong performance of the Financial Services subsidiaries. Worldwide income in 1993 was $286 million or $3.70 per share before the effects of the special items, compared with net income of $37 million or $.49 per share in 1992. However, 1993 reported results were affected by the special items described below. After the effects of the restructuring charges, the incremental expense from the accounting changes and the tax rate change, income in 1993 was $184 million or $2.39 per share. The company incurred a worldwide net loss in 1993 of $921 million or $11.91 per share after all of the special items including the cumulative effect of the accounting changes.
During the second quarter of 1993, the company announced and initiated plans to downsize and rationalize its European operations. This resulted in a second quarter provision for restructuring charges of $80 million after income taxes or $1.03 per share ($107 million before income taxes), representing costs of employment reductions to be implemented during 1993 and the next few years. The resulting restructuring should improve future overseas operating results.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, effective November 1, 1992, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and FASB Statement No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. The aggregate cumulative effect of adopting the new standards as of November 1, 1992, which relate mainly to retiree health care and life insurance benefits, was a non-cash charge of $1,105 million after income taxes or $14.30 per share ($1,728 million before income taxes). Additionally, the adoption of these standards resulted in an incremental non-cash after-tax increase in 1993 postretirement and postemployment benefits expense of $38 million or $.49 per share ($60 million before income taxes). The
incremental postretirement and postemployment benefits expense relating to the Financial Services subsidiaries was immaterial. Additional information is presented on pages 36, 37 and 47 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which enacted an increase in the United States federal statutory income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent effective January 1, 1993, was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 1993. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, income taxes relating to previously reported United States taxable income were recalculated and the United States deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date were revalued during the fourth quarter of 1993 using the new tax rate of 35 percent. This resulted in a credit of $16 million or $.21 per share to the provision for income taxes. This tax rate change had an immaterial effect on the Financial Services subsidiaries. Additional information is presented on page 39 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The company's total worldwide net sales and revenues, which include net sales of equipment and revenues from the credit, insurance and health care operations, increased 11 percent to $7,754 million in 1993 compared with net sales and revenues of $6,961 million in 1992. Worldwide net sales of equipment to dealers were $6,479 million in 1993, an increase of 13 percent from sales of $5,723 million last year. The physical volume of the company's worldwide sales to dealers increased approximately nine percent in 1993. Worldwide production tonnage of all John Deere products in 1993 was 11 percent higher than last year.
Finance and interest income decreased nine percent to $563 million in 1993 compared with $615 million last year, while insurance and health care premiums increased 12 percent to $554 million in the current year compared with $496 million in 1992.
Worldwide net sales of John Deere agricultural equipment increased eight percent to $4,078 million in 1993 from last year's volume of $3,759 million. Worldwide industrial equipment net sales of $1,348 million increased 26 percent from $1,068 million last year. Net sales of lawn and grounds care equipment totaled $1,053 million in 1993 compared with $896 million last year, representing an increase of 18 percent.
Net sales to dealers of John Deere equipment in the United States and Canada increased 19 percent to $4,934 million compared with $4,147 million in 1992. Net sales of equipment overseas totaled $1,545 million, a decrease of two percent compared with last year's net sales of $1,576 million. Excluding the effects of price increases and changes in currency relationships, the physical volume of overseas sales was approximately one percent higher in 1993 than in
The company's worldwide Equipment Operations, which exclude income from the credit, insurance and health care operations, had income of $114 million in 1993 before the effects of the previously mentioned special items, compared with a net loss of $107 million in 1992. Including the restructuring charges, the incremental effect of the accounting changes and the tax rate change, the Equipment Operations' income was $13 million in 1993. The Equipment Operations incurred a net loss of $1,085 million in 1993 after all of the special items including the cumulative effect of the accounting changes. Income of the company's credit subsidiaries before the cumulative effect of the accounting changes totaled $122 million in 1993, while net income after the accounting changes was $118 million compared with last year's net income of $106 million. Income from insurance and health care operations before the cumulative effect of the accounting changes was $42 million in 1993, while net income after the accounting changes totaled $39 million compared with net income of $32 million last year. Additional information is presented in the discussion of ""Credit Operations"" and ""Insurance and Health Care Operations"" on pages 30 through 32.
The improved operating results of the Equipment Operations in 1993 were attributable to the company's North American equipment operations. Sales and production volumes were higher this year in response to increased retail demand, and price realization improved in all of the company's North American equipment businesses compared with 1992 as sales incentive cost levels were significantly lower. Additionally, productivity continued to improve during 1993. North American sales increased 19 percent and production tonnage was 15 percent higher in 1993 than last year. However, the overseas equipment operations incurred a substantially higher net loss this year, primarily due to lower production volumes, higher cost levels and unfavorable changes in European currency relationships. Reflecting the effects of the improved North American operations, the worldwide ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales decreased to 83.1 percent in 1993 compared with 85.7 percent last year. The cost ratio of the overseas operations was significantly higher this year. The aggregate of the Equipment Operations' research and development and selling, administrative and general expenses was $4 million lower in 1993 compared with last year, primarily due to lower employment levels. After-tax results of the Equipment Operations in 1993 benefited by $33 million or $.43 per share from the reduction of inventories valued on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis compared to LIFO inventory benefits of $43 million or $.56 per share in 1992. Additional information is presented on page 42 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The 1993 income tax provision relating to the Equipment Operations, excluding the fourth quarter benefit from the United States tax rate change, was unfavorably affected by losses, including restructuring charges, recorded in taxing jurisdictions having low tax rates or where the company cannot currently record tax benefits, coupled with income realized in countries having higher income tax rates.
In fiscal year 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, and Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Neither Statement is expected to have a material effect on the company's net income or financial position. Additional information is presented in the ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" on page 36.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS
The following discussion of operating results by industry segment and geographic area relates to information beginning on page 34. Operating profit is defined as income before interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income taxes and certain corporate expenses, except for the operating profit of the credit segment, which includes the effect of interest expense.
Operating profit of each of the company's North American equipment operations was favorably affected by improved price realization, higher volumes and improved productivity compared with last year's results.
Before the restructuring charges and the incremental expense of the accounting changes, operating profit of the worldwide agricultural equipment segment increased to $266 million in 1993 compared with $106 million in 1992. This improvement was caused primarily by an eight percent increase in worldwide agricultural equipment sales to dealers, a nine percent increase in production tonnage and a substantial decline in sales discounts and warranty costs as a percent of gross sales in 1993. Benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $38 million this year compared with $45 million last year. Agricultural dealer receivables decreased $146 million in 1993. Including restructuring charges of $107 million and incremental expense of $36 million from the accounting changes, 1993 operating profit was $123 million.
Operating profit of the North American agricultural equipment operations, excluding the incremental expense from accounting changes, was substantially higher in the current year compared with 1992 results. This resulted from a 14 percent increase in sales, a 15 percent increase in production tonnage, a significantly lower level of sales discounts and warranty costs and improved productivity. Additionally, North American agricultural dealer receivables decreased by $108 million during 1993 reflecting the strong retail demand for the company's products.
Excluding the restructuring charges in 1993, the overseas agricultural equipment operations incurred a substantially larger operating loss in 1993 compared to 1992. Production was two percent lower than last year while the physical volume of overseas agricultural equipment sales to dealers increased approximately one percent in 1993. Low volumes, unfavorable changes in currency relationships and higher cost levels adversely affected the company's overseas performance during 1993. Overseas agricultural dealer receivables declined $38 million during 1993, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations.
The worldwide industrial equipment operations improved significantly in 1993, generating an operating profit of $36 million in 1993 before the incremental expense from the accounting changes, compared with a $71 million operating loss in 1992. In 1993, sales increased 26 percent, production tonnage increased 15 percent, sales discounts and warranty costs declined as a percent of gross sales and productivity improved. However, LIFO inventory benefits were $13 million this year compared with $20 million last year. Industrial dealer receivables increased by $41 million during 1993. This year's operating profit was $20 million including the incremental expense of $16 million from the accounting changes.
The worldwide lawn and grounds care equipment operations had a substantially higher operating profit of $107 million in 1993 excluding the incremental expense from the accounting changes, compared with $42 million in 1992. Lawn and grounds care equipment sales to dealers increased 18 percent, production was up 13 percent, sales discounts and warranty costs were lower as a percent of gross sales in 1993 and efficiency improved this year. Lawn and grounds care dealer receivables were relatively unchanged from last year's level. Including the incremental expense of $8 million from the accounting changes, operating profit was $99 million in 1993.
The combined operating profit of the credit, insurance and health care business segments increased to $247 million in 1993 from $202 million in 1992, as both segments generated higher earnings this year. Additional information on these businesses is presented in the discussion of ""Credit Operations"" and ""Insurance and Health Care Operations"" on pages 30 through 32.
On a geographic basis, the United States and Canadian equipment operations had significantly higher operating profit of $432 million in 1993 before the incremental expense from the accounting changes, compared with $74 million last year. Sales to dealers increased 19 percent in 1993 and production tonnage increased 15 percent. Efficiency improved and sales discounts and warranty costs were relatively lower in all of the company's North American businesses this year. However, LIFO inventory benefits were $13 million this year compared with $65 million last year. North American dealer receivables were reduced by $75 million during 1993. This year's operating profit totaled $372 million including the incremental expense of $60 million from the accounting changes.
Excluding restructuring charges, the overseas equipment operations incurred an operating loss of $23 million in 1993 compared with an operating profit of $3 million last year. Including restructuring charges of $107 million, the operating loss this year was $130 million. Sales to dealers and production tonnage were both two percent lower in 1993 while the physical volume of overseas net sales increased approximately one percent compared with 1992. As previously mentioned, 1993 results were adversely affected by low volumes, unfavorable changes in currency relationships and higher cost levels. However, benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $38 million in 1993 compared with no benefit last year. Overseas dealer receivables decreased $33 million during the year, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations.
OUTLOOK
As previously discussed, United States farm income is expected to achieve record levels in 1993 despite weather related production shortfalls of corn and soybeans. Due to the lower 1993 production and the resulting reduction in carryover stocks, a substantial increase in planted and harvested acreage of corn and soybeans is expected in 1994. While farm income will likely be lower in 1994 due mainly to lower corn and soybean marketings related to the 1993 production shortfall, next year's farm income should still be one of the highest in history. These developments, if coupled with more normal weather patterns and continuing lower levels of interest rates, are currently expected to result in 1994 North American industry retail sales of agricultural equipment being near the levels achieved in 1993.
European industry retail sales of agricultural equipment are expected to continue the downward trend of recent years. The European agricultural industry remains in the midst of fundamental change as revisions to government agricultural policies, GATT negotiations and the general economic environment will likely result in lower farm incomes and crop production in 1994.
The North American general economy has recovered very slowly from the 1990-91 recession, and 1994 is forecasted to be another year of moderate growth. While factors including tax increases, governmental efforts to reduce deficits, downsizing of the defense industry and recessionary conditions among many of the company's trading partners will limit general growth prospects, the lowest mortgage interest rates since the 1970s should further stimulate housing starts next year. Additionally, public construction is expected to experience moderate real growth in 1994, particularly in street, highway, bridge and sewer projects. Such development should favorably affect demand for industrial and construction equipment. Lawn and grounds care retail sales should also benefit from general economic growth and higher housing starts.
Initial 1994 worldwide production schedules, in tons, are about nine percent higher than actual 1993 output. Worldwide agricultural equipment production is scheduled to be up approximately five percent from this year when dealer receivables were reduced by $146 million. Lawn and grounds care equipment production is scheduled to increase about 10 percent, and initial industrial equipment production schedules are about 17 percent higher than 1993 output. Accordingly, results of the company's Equipment Operations are currently expected to improve significantly in 1994.
First quarter 1994 production tonnage is expected to be about 26 percent higher than in last year's depressed initial quarter when several of the company's factories were shut down for one- to two-week periods in addition to the normal holiday shutdowns.
1992 COMPARED WITH 1991 (UNAUDITED)
MARKET CONDITIONS
North American agricultural economic conditions in 1992 were generally less favorable than in 1991. Agricultural commodity prices were at favorable levels early in the fiscal year, but declined as 1992 production prospects for North American crops improved. North American grain production in 1992 increased about 16 percent over 1991 production, and grain inventories rose for most crops as commodity exports were essentially unchanged from 1991. Livestock prices reflected a similar declining trend due to increased production coupled with a sluggish general economy. Although the decline in grain prices was more than offset by higher yields and higher government payments to farmers, causing both farm cash receipts and net cash income to increase in 1992, the downward trend in market prices along with weather scares, ranging from drought concerns to early frost, and uncertainty relating to general economic conditions caused farmers to remain cautious in making new equipment purchase decisions throughout 1992. As a result of these developments, North American retail sales of agricultural equipment for both the industry and John Deere declined in 1992 compared with 1991, as retail sales of new tractors and combines decreased significantly.
While the United States general economy began to emerge from recession in 1992, the overall pace of the recovery was slow and erratic. Although housing starts increased approximately 20 percent compared with 1991, that level of improvement was much lower than normally experienced during the first year of an economic recovery. Non-residential construction declined slightly during the year, continuing the contraction that began in 1987. Public construction expenditures, however, increased somewhat in 1992, assisted by funds authorized by the 1991 Surface Transportation Act. Total construction spending increased slightly in 1992 and North American retail sales of industrial equipment for the industry and John Deere were relatively unchanged from 1991 levels.
Consumer spending for durable goods in North America during 1992 declined from the level in 1991 as consumers remained very cautious due to the recessionary environment. North American retail sales of John Deere lawn and grounds care equipment in 1992 were comparable to the volume in 1991.
Outside the United States and Canada, retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment were lower in 1992 than 1991, due primarily to weakness in Western Europe where recessionary pressures and economic uncertainties affected farmers in the European Economic Community. Overseas retail sales of the company's lawn and grounds care products increased significantly in 1992, mainly due to sales of SABO, a European manufacturer acquired in the fourth quarter of 1991. Overseas demand for industrial equipment increased in 1992, but remained at a relatively low level.
Acquisitions of receivables and leases by the company's credit operations were lower in 1992 compared with 1991. This resulted mainly from lower retail sales of John Deere agricultural equipment as well as a more competitive financing environment for recreational products. Soft market conditions continued throughout 1992 in the property/casualty insurance industry. Large catastrophic losses also affected industry results in 1992. However, John Deere's insurance and health care premium volumes increased in 1992 compared with 1991.
OPERATING RESULTS
Deere & Company's operating results for 1992 reflected the effects of lower production and sales volumes in response to soft market conditions. Although price realization improved in 1992, sales incentive costs remained relatively high due to very competitive markets.
The company's total worldwide net sales and revenues declined one percent to $6,961 million in 1992 compared with net sales and revenues of $7,055 million in 1991. Worldwide net sales of equipment to dealers were $5,723 million in 1992, a decrease of two percent from sales of $5,848 million in 1991. The physical volume of the company's worldwide sales to dealers decreased approximately eight percent in 1992. Worldwide production tonnage of all John Deere products in 1992 was seven percent lower than in 1991.
Finance and interest income decreased six percent to $615 million in 1992 compared with $654 million in 1991, while insurance and health care premiums increased 12 percent to $496 million in 1992 compared with $444 million in 1991.
Worldwide net sales of John Deere agricultural equipment decreased seven percent to $3,759 million in 1992 from a volume of $4,054 million in 1991. Worldwide industrial equipment net sales of $1,068 million increased five percent from $1,014 million in 1991. Net sales of lawn and grounds care equipment totaled $896 million in 1992 compared with $780 million in 1991, representing an increase of 15 percent resulting mainly from SABO sales.
Net sales to dealers of John Deere equipment in the United States and Canada decreased five percent to $4,147 million compared with $4,349 million in 1991. Net sales of equipment overseas totaled $1,576 million, an increase of five percent compared with net sales of $1,499 million in 1991. Excluding the effects of price increases and changes in currency relationships, the physical volume of overseas sales was approximately one percent lower in 1992 than in 1991.
Worldwide net income was $37 million or $.49 per share in 1992 compared with a net loss of $20 million or $.27 per share in 1991. Results in 1991 included a fourth quarter after-tax restructuring charge of $120 million or $1.58 per share, described below. The company's worldwide Equipment Operations, which exclude income from the credit, insurance and health care operations, incurred a net loss of $107 million in 1992 compared with a net loss of $132 million in 1991. Excluding the restructuring charge, 1991 worldwide net income would have been $100 million, and the Equipment Operations' net loss would have been $12 million. Net income of the company's credit subsidiaries totaled $106 million in 1992 compared with $84 million in 1991. Net income from insurance and health care operations was $32 million in 1992 compared with $28 million in 1991. Additional information is presented in the discussion of ""Credit Operations"" and ""Insurance and Health Care Operations"" on pages 30 through 32.
Results of the Equipment Operations in both 1992 and 1991 were affected by low production and sales volumes in response to weak retail demand, particularly in 1992. Although sales incentive costs moderated in 1992, they remained relatively high and continued to adversely affect operating results. Reflecting the effects of lower production volumes, higher manufacturing cost levels, and a lower benefit in 1992 from the reduction of inventories valued on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, the worldwide ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales increased 85.7 percent in 1992 compared with 83.9 percent in 1991.
Worldwide net income and results of the Equipment Operations in 1992 and 1991 were affected by certain non-recurring or unusual items. After-tax results in 1992 and 1991 benefited by $43 million or $.56 per share and $84 million or $1.11 per share, respectively, from the reduction of LIFO inventories. During the fourth quarter of 1991, the company initiated plans to reduce costs and rationalize operations, both in North America and overseas. This resulted in a fourth quarter after-tax provision for restructuring costs of $120 million, representing costs of employment reductions and the closure of a ductile iron foundry. Additional information is presented on page 37 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS
The following discussion of operating results by industry segment and geographic area relates to information beginning on page 34.
Operating profit of the worldwide agricultural equipment segment declined in 1992 to $106 million compared with $123 million in 1991. Excluding a restructuring charge of $128 million, 1991 operating profit would have been $251 million. This significant decline was caused primarily by a seven percent decrease in worldwide agricultural equipment sales to dealers and a 13 percent decrease in production tonnage. However, sales discounts and warranty costs, as a percent of gross sales, declined in 1992. Pretax benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $45 million in 1992 compared with $102 million in 1991. Agricultural dealer receivables increased $69 million in 1992.
Operating profit of the North American agricultural equipment operations was substantially lower in 1992 compared with 1991 results excluding restructuring charges. This resulted from a 15 percent decrease in production tonnage, a 10 percent decline in sales and a lower LIFO inventory benefit. However, sales discounts and warranty costs were relatively lower in 1992. North American agricultural dealer receivables increased by $34 million during 1992.
The overseas agricultural equipment operations incurred an operating loss in 1992 compared with an operating profit in 1991 excluding restructuring charges. The physical volume of overseas agricultural equipment sales to dealers declined approximately seven percent in 1992 and production was eight percent lower than in 1991. Overseas agricultural dealer receivables increased $35 million during 1992.
The worldwide industrial equipment operations incurred an operating loss of $71 million in 1992 compared with a $131 million loss in 1991. Last year's operating loss would have totaled $87 million excluding restructuring charges of $44 million. Production declined one percent in 1992, while sales increased five percent and sales discounts and warranty costs reflected significant improvement in 1992 from 1991 levels. Additionally, LIFO inventory benefits were $20 million in 1992 compared with $14 million in 1991. Industrial dealer receivables were reduced by $77 million during 1992.
The worldwide lawn and grounds care equipment operations had an operating profit of $42 million in 1992 compared with $24 million in 1991, which included restructuring charges of $10 million. Lawn and grounds care equipment sales to dealers increased 15 percent, production was up 31 percent and sales discounts and warranty costs were lower in 1992. Results in 1992 benefited significantly from the operations of SABO. Excluding SABO production and sales for 1992, sales to dealers would have increased five percent and production would have increased 17 percent. Benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $12 million last year while there was no benefit in 1992. Lawn and grounds care dealer receivables were relatively unchanged from the level in 1991.
The combined operating profit of the credit, insurance and health care business segments increased to $202 million in 1992 from $164 million in 1991, primarily as a result of higher credit earnings. Additional information on these businesses is presented in the discussion of ""Credit Operations"" and ""Insurance and Health Care Operations"" on pages 30 through 32.
On a geographic basis, the United States and Canadian equipment operations had an operating profit of $74 million in 1992 compared with a profit of $26 million in 1991. The operating profit in 1991 would have totaled $188 million excluding restructuring costs of $162 million. Sales to dealers declined five percent from 1991 and production tonnage decreased nine percent. Sales discounts and warranty costs were relatively lower in all of the company's businesses in 1992, but LIFO inventory benefits were $65 million in 1992 compared with $104 million in 1991. North American dealer receivables were reduced by $75 million during 1992.
The overseas equipment operations had an operating profit of $3 million in 1992 compared with an operating loss of $10 million in 1991. However, restructuring charges of $20 million were incurred in 1991. Sales to dealers increased five percent and production tonnage was three percent lower in 1992. Additionally, benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $24 million in 1991 compared with no benefit in 1992. As previously mentioned, 1992 results benefited significantly from the operations of SABO. The physical volume of overseas net sales declined approximately one percent compared with 1991. Overseas dealer receivables increased $64 million during 1992.
CREDIT OPERATIONS
Deere & Company's credit subsidiaries consist of John Deere Credit Company and its subsidiaries in the United States and John Deere Finance Limited in Canada. The credit operations bear all credit risk, net of recovery from withholdings from dealers, and perform all servicing and collection functions on retail notes and leases on John Deere products acquired by the credit subsidiaries from the Equipment Operations. The Equipment Operations receive compensation from the United States credit operations for originating retail notes and leases. The Equipment Operations are reimbursed by the credit operations for staff support and other administrative services at estimated cost, and for credit lines provided by Deere & Company based on utilization of the lines. The credit subsidiaries receive compensation from the Equipment Operations approximately equal to the normal net finance income on retail notes and leases for periods during which finance charges have been waived or reduced.
Condensed combined financial information of the credit subsidiaries in millions of dollars follows:
Total acquisitions of credit receivables and leases by the credit subsidiaries increased five percent during 1993 compared with acquisitions in 1992. The higher acquisitions this year resulted from an increased volume of John Deere leases, revolving charge accounts and wholesale receivables, which more than offset lower acquisitions of retail notes.
During 1993, net retail notes acquired by the credit subsidiaries totaled $2,401 million, a three percent decrease compared with 1992 acquisitions of $2,470 million. Acquisitions of recreational product retail notes accounted for 10 percent of total note acquisitions in 1993 and 11 percent in 1992. Acquisitions of John Deere equipment notes were slightly lower in the current year due primarily to a higher level of cash purchases by John Deere customers and a more competitive agricultural financing environment. Acquisitions of recreational product retail notes were significantly lower in the current year, due mainly to a more competitive financing environment.
The balance of revolving charge accounts financed at October 31, 1993 increased by $63 million compared with one year ago, while wholesale notes decreased by $2 million and operating leases increased by $34 million compared with October 31, 1992.
The balance of net credit receivables and leases financed at October 31, 1993 totaled $3,758 million compared with $4,400 million at the end of 1992. This decrease resulted primarily from sales of retail notes during 1993 that generated net proceeds of $1,143 million. Additional information is presented on page 42. Net credit receivables and leases administered, which include receivables previously sold but still administered, amounted to $5,195 million at October 31, 1993 compared with $5,136 million at October 31, 1992. The net unpaid balance of retail notes previously sold was $1,394 million at October 31, 1993 compared with $688 million at October 31, 1992.
Income of the credit operations, before the cumulative effect of adopting FASB Statement Nos. 106 and 112, was $122 million in 1993 compared with $106 million in 1992 and $84 million in 1991. On that same basis, the ratio of earnings before fixed charges to
fixed charges was 1.97 to 1 in 1993, 1.74 to 1 in 1992 and 1.50 to 1 in 1991. Net income in the current year was significantly higher than in 1992 mainly because of higher securitization and servicing fee income from retail notes previously sold, lower credit losses, higher financing margins and increased gains from the sale of retail notes, which more than offset the effects of a lower volume of credit receivables and leases financed. Net income of the credit operations totaled $118 million in 1993 including the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting standards. Additional information on changes in accounting is presented on pages 36, 37 and 47 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Total revenues of the credit operations decreased two percent in 1993. The average balance of total net credit receivables and leases financed was seven percent lower in 1993 compared with last year, due primarily to the sale of receivables during 1993. Revenues have also been affected by the lower level of interest rates and correspondingly lower finance charges earned on the credit receivable and lease portfolio in 1993 compared with last year. These decreases in revenues were partially offset by securitization and servicing fee income from retail notes previously sold. Additionally, lower borrowing rates and a decrease in average borrowings this year resulted in a 12 percent decrease in interest expense in 1993 compared to 1992.
Net income in 1992 was substantially higher than in 1991 mainly because of a higher average volume of receivables and leases financed and improved credit loss experience. Net income in 1992 also benefited from after-tax gains of $5.6 million from sales of retail notes. The average balance of total net receivables and leases financed was six percent higher in 1992 compared with 1991. However, total revenues of the credit operations decreased three percent in 1992 compared with 1991 as the average yield earned on the portfolio was lower in 1992. While revenues were affected by the lower level of interest rates and the correspondingly lower finance charges earned in 1992 compared with 1991, borrowing costs were also lower in 1992. Interest expense was down 16 percent despite the higher level of receivables and leases financed.
Total credit receivable and lease amounts 60 days or more past-due were $16 million at October 31, 1993 compared with $23 million at October 31, 1992. These past-due amounts represented .34 percent of the face value of credit receivables and leases held at October 31, 1993 and .40 percent at October 31, 1992. The allowance for credit losses, which totaled $83 million at the end of 1993 and $89 million one year ago, represented 2.17 percent and 1.98 percent, respectively, of the balance of total net credit receivables and leases financed at October 31, 1993 and 1992. Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants, which are available for potential credit losses, amounted to $119 million at October 31, 1993.
John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) is a subsidiary of John Deere Credit Company. Deere & Company has expressed an intention of conducting business with the Capital Corporation on such terms that its ratio of earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges will not be less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. These arrangements are not intended to make Deere & Company responsible for the payment of obligations of this credit subsidiary.
INSURANCE AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS
Deere & Company's insurance subsidiaries consist of John Deere Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries in the United States, which provide life/health and property/casualty coverages to the general public nationwide, and John Deere Insurance Company of Canada. John Deere Health Care, Inc., directly or through its health maintenance organizations, provides administrative services and managed health care programs for Deere & Company and other companies located in Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Tennessee.
Condensed combined financial information of the insurance and health care operations in millions of dollars follows:
Insurance premium revenue of $26 million in 1993, $27 million in 1992 and $30 million in 1991 and health care premium revenue of $118 million in 1993, $114 million in 1992 and $102 million in 1991 related to coverages provided to Deere & Company and its subsidiaries.
Income of the insurance and health care operations, before the cumulative effect of adopting FASB Statement Nos. 106 and 112, totaled $42 million in 1993 compared with $32 million in 1992 and $28 million in 1991. The increase in 1993 net income resulted mainly from improved insurance underwriting income compared
with last year which had higher loss experience, and higher health care income as a result of higher volumes and improved underwriting performance this year. Insurance and health care premiums increased 10 percent in 1993, while claims, policy benefits and other expenses increased six percent from last year. Net income of the insurance and health care operations totaled $39 million in 1993 including the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting standards. Additional information on changes in accounting is presented on pages 36, 37 and 47 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The increase in 1992 net income compared with 1991 resulted mainly from improved insurance income. Although underwriting income was lower, insurance earnings in 1992 benefited from higher investment income and realized capital gains on investments. Health care income increased in 1992 as a result of higher investment income. Insurance and health care premiums increased about 11 percent in 1992, while claims, policy benefits and other expenses also increased approximately 11 percent from 1991.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY (UNAUDITED)
The discussion of capital resources and liquidity focuses on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. The nature of the Company's Equipment Operations and Financial Services businesses is so different that most of the asset, liability and cash flow categories do not lend themselves to simple combination. Additionally, the fundamental differences between these businesses are reflected in different financial measurements commonly used by investors, rating agencies and financial analysts. In recognition of these differences and to provide clarity with respect to the analyses of the capital resources and liquidity of these different businesses, the following discussion has been organized to discuss separately, where appropriate, the company's Equipment Operations, Financial Services operations and the consolidated totals.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS
The company's equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to large seasonal variations in financing requirements for receivables from dealers and inventories. Accordingly, to the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented from external borrowing sources.
Cash flows from operating activities were significantly higher in 1993 compared with 1992, mainly as a result of higher net income (excluding non-cash changes in accounting and non-cash restructuring charges accrued in 1993), a larger aggregate decrease in receivables and inventories this year and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses compared with decreases in 1992. Cash flows from operating activities, which include dividends of $86 million received from the Financial Services subsidiaries, totaled $702 million in 1993. Proceeds from the issuance of additional common stock totaled $586 million during 1993. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used primarily to fund a decrease in net borrowings of $504 million, an increase of $359 million in receivables from the Financial Services subsidiaries, additions to property and equipment of $197 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $153 million and a $31 million increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of $1,300 million in cash, which includes dividends of $273 million received from the Financial Services subsidiaries. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock were $590 million during this three-year period. The aggregate amount of these cash flows was used mainly to fund additions to property and equipment of $768 million, stockholders' dividends of $458 million, an increase in receivables from Financial Services subsidiaries of $436 million, acquisitions of businesses of $71 million, a decrease in net borrowings of $56 million and an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $46 million.
Net dealer accounts and notes receivable result mainly from sales to dealers of equipment that is being carried in their inventories. Total dealer receivables decreased by $108 million during 1993. North American agricultural equipment dealer receivables decreased $108 million during the year, North American industrial equipment dealer receivables increased by $40 million during 1993, while North American lawn and grounds care equipment receivables declined by $7 million. Total overseas dealer receivables were $33 million lower than one year ago, due primarily to the effect of lower foreign currency exchange rates in 1993. The ratios of worldwide net dealer accounts and notes receivable to fiscal year net sales at October 31 were 43 percent in 1993, 51 percent in 1992 and 51 percent in 1991.
The collection period for receivables from dealers averages less than 12 months. The percentage of receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months was 11 percent at October 31, 1993 compared with 11 percent at October 31, 1992 and 16 percent at October 31, 1991.
Company-owned inventories decreased by $60 million in 1993 mainly as a result of sales exceeding production levels and continued improvement in inventory management practices.
Capital expenditures were $196 million in 1993 compared with $269 million in 1992 and $295 million in 1991 primarily due to lower new product expenditures. It is currently estimated that capital expenditures for 1994 will be approximately $230 million. As in recent years, the 1994 expenditures will be primarily for new product and operations improvement programs.
Total interest-bearing debt of the Equipment Operations was $1,546 million at the end of 1993 compared with $2,090 million at the end of 1992 and $1,899 million at the end of 1991. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and stockholders' equity) at the end of 1993, 1992, and 1991 was 42.6 percent, 44.1 percent and 40.1 percent, respectively.
The average short-term borrowings and the weighted average interest rate incurred thereon during 1993, excluding the current portion of long-term borrowings, were $1,050 million and 6.0 percent, respectively, compared with $1,030 million and 7.2 percent, respectively, in 1992. During 1991, average short-term borrowings were $1,006 million with an average interest rate of 8.7 percent.
In November 1993, the company announced that on January 4, 1994 it will redeem the $80 million balance of outstanding 8% debentures due 2002. Additional information is included in the discussion of ""Long-Term Borrowings"" on pages 44 through 45.
In September 1993, the company issued 8,050,000 shares of common stock in a public offering. The net proceeds of $535 million were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the reduction of indebtedness of the Equipment Operations and the credit subsidiaries.
FINANCIAL SERVICES
The Financial Services credit subsidiaries rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of borrowings and equity capital. Additionally, the Capital Corporation periodically sells substantial amounts of retail notes in the public markets. The insurance and health care operations generate their funds through internal operations and have no external borrowings.
Cash flows from the company's Financial Services operating activities were $218 million in 1993. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $441 million in 1993, primarily due to net proceeds of $1,143 million received from the securitization and sale of receivables in the public market, which was partially offset by funds used for credit receivable and lease acquisitions which exceeded collections by $676 million. The aggregate cash provided by operating and investing activities was used for financing activities and a $90 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. Cash used for financing activities totaled $569 million in 1993, representing a net decrease in outside borrowings of $842 million and $86 million of dividends paid to the Equipment Operations, which were partially offset by an increase in payables to the Equipment Operations of $359 million. Within the Financial Services operations, the positive cash flows from insurance and health care operations were primarily invested in marketable securities.
Over the past three years, the Financial Services operating activities have provided $760 million in cash. An increase in payables to the Equipment Operations has also provided $436 million during the same period. These amounts have been used mainly to fund a decrease of $387 million in net outside borrowings, $273 million of dividends to the Equipment Operations, an increase in receivables relating to asset backed securities and operating leases of $264 million, an increase of $184 million in marketable securities and an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $107 million.
Marketable securities carried at cost consist primarily of debt securities held by the insurance and health care operations in support of their obligations to policyholders. The $41 million increase in 1993 resulted primarily from the continuing growth in the insurance and health care operations.
Net credit receivables decreased by $676 million in 1993 compared with 1992. The discussion of ""Credit Operations"" on pages 30 through 31, and pages 41 through 42 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information on these receivables.
Total interest-bearing debt of the credit subsidiaries was $2,603 million at the end of 1993 compared with $3,463 million at the end of 1992 and $3,779 million at the end of 1991. Strong capital positions for both the credit and insurance operations continued during 1993. The credit subsidiaries' ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholders' equity was 3.8 to 1 at the end of 1993 compared with 4.6 to 1 at the end of 1992 and 4.9 to 1 at the end of 1991.
The average short-term borrowings of the credit subsidiaries and the weighted average interest rate incurred thereon during 1993, excluding the current portion of long-term borrowings, were $1,401 million and 4.3 percent, respectively, compared with $2,150 million and 4.9 percent, respectively, in 1992. During 1991, average short-term borrowings were $2,135 million with an average interest rate of 7.3 percent.
In 1993, the Capital Corporation issued $150 million of 5% notes due in 1995 and $200 million of 4-5/8% notes due in 1996. The Capital Corporation also retired $150 million of 7.4% notes due in 1993, $125 million of 9.0% debentures due in 1993 and $47 million of 7-1/2% debentures due in 1998. During 1993, the Capital Corporation issued $337 million and retired $176 million of medium-term notes. In November 1993, the Capital Corporation announced that on January 4, 1994 it will redeem the $40 million balance of outstanding 9.35% subordinated debentures due 2003. Additional information on these borrowings is included in the discussion of ""Long-Term Borrowings"" on pages 44 through 45.
In the 1993 and 1992 fiscal years, the Capital Corporation received net proceeds of $1,143 million and $455 million, respectively, from the sale of retail notes to limited-purpose business trusts, which utilized the notes as collateral for the issuance of asset backed securities to the public. In the 1992 fiscal year, the Capital Corporation also sold retail notes to a financial institution receiving proceeds of $228 million. Retail notes were not sold by the Capital Corporation in the 1991 fiscal year. Additional sales of retail notes are expected to be made in the future.
CONSOLIDATED
The company maintains unsecured lines of credit with various banks in North America and overseas. Some of the lines are available to both the Equipment Operations and certain credit subsidiaries. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $3,344 million at October 31, 1993, $2,296 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, total short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines are three long-term credit agreement commitments totaling $3,276 million.
Stockholders' equity was $2,085 million at October 31, 1993 compared with $2,650 million and $2,836 million at October 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The decrease in 1993 was caused primarily by the net loss of $921 million resulting from the cumulative adjustment for the adoption of FASB Statement Nos. 106 and 112 described on pages 36 and 37. In addition, stockholders' equity decreased due to dividends declared of $157 million, an increase
of $59 million in the minimum pension liability adjustment described under ""Pension Benefits"" on page 37 and a $22 million change in the cumulative translation adjustment, which were partially offset by an increase in common stock of $597 million.
INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1993, 1992 AND 1991
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine industry segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components, insurance and health care premiums, and finance charges. Interarea sales represent sales of complete machines, service parts and components to units in other geographic areas. Intersegment sales and revenues are generally priced at market prices, and interarea sales are generally priced at cost plus a share of total operating profit. Overseas operations are defined to include all activities of divisions, subsidiaries and affiliated companies conducted outside the United States and Canada.
Information relating to operations by industry segment in millions of dollars follows. Comments relating to this data are included in Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The company views and has historically disclosed its operations as consisting of two geographic areas, the United States and Canada, and overseas, shown below. The percentages shown in the captions for net sales and revenues, operating profit (loss) and identifiable assets indicate the approximate proportion of each amount that relates to either the United States only or to the company's Europe, Africa and Middle East division, the only overseas area deemed to be significant for disclosure purposes. The percentages are based upon a three-year average for 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Total exports from the United States were $961 million in 1993, $778 million in 1992 and $713 million in 1991. Exports increased in 1993 as a result of higher demand in Canada, Europe and Australia, and increased in 1992 due to higher demand in Mexico and Australia. Exports from the Europe, Africa and Middle East division were $423 million in 1993, $442 million in 1992 and $416 million in 1991. A large part of these exports were to the United States and Canada.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a majority ownership. Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate. Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost. Unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates at October 31, 1993 consisted primarily of equipment affiliates in Brazil, Mexico and the United States, and a United States reinsurance affiliate. Consolidated retained earnings at October 31, 1993 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of $46 million. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were $2 million in 1993, $2 million in 1992 and $6 million in 1991.
The company's consolidated financial statements and some information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format which includes data grouped as follows:
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS--These data include the company's agricultural equipment, industrial equipment and lawn and grounds care equipment operations with Financial Services reflected on the equity basis. Data relating to the above equipment operations, including the consolidated group data in the income statement, are also referred to as ""Equipment Operations' in this report.
FINANCIAL SERVICES--These data include the company's credit, insurance and health care operations.
CONSOLIDATED--These data represent the consolidation of the Equipment Operations and Financial Services in conformity with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 94. References to ""Deere & Company"" or ""the company"" refer to the entire enterprise.
Sales of equipment and service parts are generally recorded by the company when they are shipped to independent dealers. Provisions for sales incentives and product warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the incentive programs. There is a time lag, which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand, between the dates when the company records sales to dealers and when dealers sell the equipment to retail customers.
Retail notes receivable include unearned finance income in the face amount of the notes, which is amortized into income over the lives of the notes on the effective-yield basis. Unearned finance income on variable-rate notes is adjusted monthly based on fluctuations in the base rate of a specified bank. Financing leases receivable include unearned lease income, which is equal to the excess of the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value over the cost of the equipment, and is recognized as revenue over the lease terms on the effective-yield basis. Rental payments applicable to equipment on operating leases are recorded as income on a straight-line method over the lease terms. Assets on operating leases are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line method over the terms of the leases. Costs incurred in the acquisition of retail notes and leases are deferred and amortized into income over the expected lives of the affected receivables on the effective-yield basis. Interest charged to revolving charge account customers and on wholesale receivables is based on the balances outstanding.
During 1993 and 1992, the credit subsidiaries sold retail notes to limited purpose business trusts, which utilized the notes as collateral for the issuance of asset backed securities to the public. At the time of the sales, ""other receivables"" from the trusts were recorded at net present value. The receivables relate to deposits made pursuant to recourse provisions and other payments to be received under the sales agreements. The receivables will be amortized to their value at maturity using the interest method. The credit subsidiaries are also compensated by the trusts for certain expenses incurred in the administration of these receivables. Securitization and servicing fee income includes both the amortization of the above receivables and reimbursed administrative expenses.
Insurance and health care premiums are generally recognized as earned over the terms of the related policies. Insurance and health care claims and reserves include liabilities for unpaid claims and future policy benefits. Policy acquisition costs, such as commissions, premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses, which vary with the production of business, are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related policies. The liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses is based on estimated costs of selling the claim using past experience adjusted for current trends. The liability for future policy benefits on traditional life insurance policies is based on the mortality, interest and withdrawal assumptions prevailing at the time the policies are issued. The liability for universal life type contracts is the total of the policyholder accumulated funds. Interest rates used in calculating future policyholder benefits and universal life account values range from four and three-quarters to 11 percent.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, effective November 1, 1992. Prior quarters of 1993 were restated as required by this Statement. This standard generally requires the accrual of retiree health care and other postretirement benefits during employees' years of active service. The company elected to recognize the pretax transition obligation of $1,712 million ($1,095 million or $14.17 per share net of deferred income taxes) as a one-time charge to earnings in the current year. This obligation represents the portion of future retiree benefit costs related to service already rendered by both active and retired employees up to November 1, 1992. The 1993 postretirement benefits expense and related disclosures have been determined according to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 106. For years prior to 1993, postretirement benefits were generally included in costs as covered expenses were actually incurred. The adoption of FASB Statement No. 106 resulted in an incremental pretax expense of $58 million ($37 million or $.48 per share net of deferred income taxes) compared with expense determined under the previous accounting principle. This increase in the current year expense is in addition to the previously mentioned one-time charge relating to the transition obligation. The incremental postretirement benefits expense relating to the Financial Services subsidiaries was immaterial. Additional information is presented in the discussion of ""Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"" on pages 38 through 39, and the ""Supplemental 1993 and 1992 Quarterly Information (Unaudited)"" on page 47.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, effective November 1, 1992. This Statement requires the accrual of certain benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement during employees' years
of active service. The company previously accrued certain disability related benefits when the disability occurred. Results for the first quarter of 1993 were restated for the cumulative pretax charge resulting from this change in accounting as of November 1, 1992 which totaled $16 million ($10 million or $.13 per share net of deferred income taxes). The adoption of FASB Statement No. 112 resulted in incremental 1993 pretax expense of $2 million ($1 million or $.01 per share net of deferred income taxes) compared with expense determined under the previous accounting principle. This increase in the current year expense is in addition to the previously mentioned one-time cumulative charge. The adoption of FASB Statement No. 112 had an immaterial effect on the Financial Services subsidiaries. Additional information is presented in the ""Supplemental 1993 and 1992 Quarterly Information (Unaudited)"" on page 47.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments. Disclosures of the fair values of financial instruments which do not approximate the carrying values in the financial statements are included in the appropriate financial statement notes. Fair values of other financial instruments approximate the carrying amounts because of the short maturities or current market interest rates of those instruments.
In the second quarter of 1992, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. See ""Income Taxes"" on page 40 for further information.
In December 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts. This Statement eliminates the practice of reporting amounts for reinsured contracts net of the effects of reinsurance. The new standard will be adopted in the first quarter of the 1994 fiscal year and will not have a material effect on the company's net income or financial position.
In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. This statement requires that the insurance and health care operations' investments in debt and equity securities be classified in the following three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as trading securities will be carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. Investment securities held by the company are not considered trading securities. Debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity; except for certain changes in circumstances such as credit risk, will be classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost. The company currently carries its debt securities on this basis. Securities that are not categorized as either trading or held to maturity will be classified as available for sale. Securities in this category, which will include the company's equity securities, will be carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings but shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The company intends to designate all but a small portion of its debt securities as held-to-maturity and, therefore, retain the current amortized cost basis of accounting. The new standard must be adopted no later than fiscal year 1995 and is not expected to have a material effect on the company's net income or financial position.
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with 1993 financial statement presentations.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS
During the second quarter of 1993, the company initiated plans to downsize and rationalize its European operations. This resulted in a second quarter restructuring charge of $80 million after income taxes or $1.03 per share ($107 million before income taxes). The charge mainly represents the cost of employment reductions to be implemented during 1993 and the next few years.
In 1991, the company initiated plans to reduce costs and rationalize operations, both in North America and overseas. This resulted in a 1991 restructuring charge of $120 million after income taxes or $1.58 per share ($182 million before income taxes), representing costs of employment reductions and the closure of a ductile iron foundry.
PENSION BENEFITS
The company has several pension plans covering substantially all of its United States employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The United States plans and significant foreign plans in Canada, Germany and France are defined benefit plans in which the benefits are based primarily on years of service and employee compensation near retirement. It is the company's policy to fund its United States plans according to the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and income tax regulations. In Canada and France, the company's funding is in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations, while the German pension plan is unfunded. Plan assets in the United States, Canada and France consist primarily of common stocks, common trust funds, government securities and corporate debt securities.
Provisions of FASB Statement No. 87 require the company to record a minimum pension liability relating to certain unfunded pension obligations, establish an intangible asset relating thereto and reduce stockholders' equity. At October 31, 1993, this minimum pension liability was remeasured, as required by the Statement. As a result, the minimum pension liability was adjusted from $452 million at October 31, 1992 to $515 million at October 31, 1993; the related intangible asset was adjusted from $215 million to $181 million; and the amount by which stockholders' equity had been reduced was adjusted from $156 million to $215 million (net of applicable deferred income taxes of $81 million in 1992 and $119 million in 1993). The change in the minimum pension liability at October 31, 1993 resulted mainly from an increase in pension fund liabilities due to a change in mortality assumptions and the utilization of a lower discount rate.
The expense of all pension plans was $151 million in 1993, $121 million in 1922 and $94 million in 1991. In 1993, pension expense increased $44 million from a change in mortality assumptions and other actuarial experience and by $6 million from utilization of a lower discount rate, which were partially offset by a reduction of $20 million resulting from favorable investment experience. In 1992, pension expense increased by $27 million due to changes in plan benefits, $18 million from the utilization of a lower discount rate and $16 million due to changes in experience and exchange rates, which were partially offset by a reduction of $34 million resulting mainly from favorable investment experience.
The components of net periodic pension cost and the significant assumptions for the United States plans consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:
A reconciliation of the funded status of the United States plans at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:
The components of net periodic pension cost and the significant assumptions for the foreign plans consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percents:
A reconciliation of the funded status of the foreign plans at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
The company generally provides defined benefit health care and life insurance plans for retired employees in the United States and Canada. Provisions of the benefit plans for hourly employees are in large part subject to collective bargaining. The plans for salaried employees include certain cost-sharing provisions. It is the company's policy to fund a portion of its obligations for the United States postretirement health care benefit plans under provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(h). Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks, common trust funds, government securities and corporate debt securities.
During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, effective November 1, 1992. Additional information is presented in the ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" on page 36, and the ""Supplemental 1993 and 1992 Quarterly Information (Unaudited)"" on page 47.
The components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost of the United States and Canadian plans in 1993 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
A reconciliation of the funded status of the United States and Canadian plans at October 31, 1993 in millions of dollars follows:
Actuarial assumptions used to determine 1993 costs for the United States and Canadian plans include a discount rate of 8.25 percent and a 9.7 percent expected long-term rate of return on assets. The discount rate used in determining the October 31, 1993 benefit obligations was 7.5 percent. The annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rate) was assumed to be 1.3 percent for 1994, which is lower than normal due to the effects of plan changes, particularly the migration of employees to managed care programs and company operated clinics. Subsequent to 1994, the trend rate is assumed to be 9.0 percent in 1995, decreasing gradually to 4.3 percent by the year 2001. These trend rates reflect the company's previous experience and current plans for future cost control including the effects of managed care. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of October 31, 1993 by $241 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefits cost for the year then ended by $25 million.
INCOME TAXES
The provision (credit) for income taxes by location of the taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
Based upon location of the company's operations, the consolidated income (loss) before income taxes in the United States in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $353 million, $49 million and $(19) million, respectively, and in foreign countries was $(80) million, $(6) million and $(7) million, respectively. Certain overseas operations are branches of Deere & Company and are therefore subject to United States as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income (loss) by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision (credit) by taxing jurisdiction are therefore not directly related.
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which enacted an increase in the United States federal statutory income tax rate effective January 1, 1993, was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 1993. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the United States deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date were revalued during the fourth quarter of 1993 using the new tax rate of 35 percent. This resulted in a credit of $17 million or $.22 per share to the provision for income taxes. This tax rate change had an immaterial effect on the Financial Services subsidiaries.
A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision (credit) and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follows:
In the second quarter of 1992, the company adopted FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. There was no cumulative effect of adoption or current effect on continuing operations mainly because the company had previously adopted FASB Statement No. 96, Accounting for Income Taxes, in 1988.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:
At October 31, 1993, accumulated earnings in certain overseas subsidiaries and affiliates totaled $361 million for which no provision for United States income taxes or foreign withholding taxes had been made, because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.
Deere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States which includes certain wholly-owned Financial Services subsidiaries, primarily John Deere Capital Corporation, John Deere Credit, Inc., and the health care subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns. Deere & Company's insurance subsidiaries file separate federal income tax returns.
During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the company recognized $4 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of income tax benefits relating to tax loss and tax credit carryforwards from previous years. At October 31, 1993, certain foreign tax loss and tax credit carryforwards were available. The expiration dates and amounts in millions of dollars are as follows: 1996 - $2, $1997 - $5, 1998 - $9 and unlimited - $7.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities are held by the insurance and health care subsidiaries. Fixed maturities, consisting of corporate bonds, government bonds and certificates of deposit, are carried at amortized cost and generally held to maturity. Equity securities, consisting of common and preferred stocks, are carried at cost. Realized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method. A discussion of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which could affect the carrying value of marketable securities starting in fiscal year 1995, is found on page 37 of the ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"".
The value of marketable securities at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:
The carrying value and market value of fixed maturities in millions of dollars follows:
The contractual maturities of fixed maturities at October 31, 1993 in millions of dollars follows:
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations. Proceeds from the sales of fixed maturities were $23 million in 1993, $18 million in 1992 and $34 million in 1991. Gross gains of $1 million in 1993, $1 million in 1992 and $12 million in 1991 and gross losses of none in 1993, none in 1992 and $4 million in 1991 were realized on those sales.
DEALER ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE
Dealer accounts and notes receivable at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
At October 31, 1993 and 1992, dealer notes included above were $414 million and $397 million, respectively.
Dealer accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales to dealers of John Deere agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care equipment. The company retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with these receivables. Generally, terms to dealers require payments as the equipment which secures the indebtedness is sold to retail customers. Interest is charged on balances outstanding after certain interest-free periods, which range from six to nine months for agricultural tractors, six months for industrial equipment, and from six to 24 months for most other equipment. Dealer accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural, industrial and lawn and grounds care business sectors as shown above. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.
CREDIT RECEIVABLES
Credit receivables at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
At October 31, 1993, $116 million of the net credit receivables were financed by the Equipment Operations and $3,639 million by the credit subsidiaries.
Credit receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agricultural, industrial, lawn and grounds care, and recreational product business sectors as shown above. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The company retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes and leases.
At October 31, 1993, the estimated fair value of total net credit receivables was $3,844 million compared to the carrying value of $3,755 million. The fair values of fixed-rate retail notes and financing leases were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. The fair values of variable-rate retail notes, revolving charge accounts and wholesale notes approximate the carrying amounts.
Credit receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October 31 are scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:
The maximum maturities for retail notes are generally seven years for agricultural equipment, five years for industrial equipment, six years for lawn and grounds care equipment and 15 years for recreational products. The maximum term for financing leases is six years, while the maximum maturity for wholesale notes is 24 months.
The company's United States credit subsidiary, John Deere Capital Corporation, received net proceeds of $1,143 million in 1993 and $455 million in 1992 from the sale of retail notes to limited-purpose business trusts, which utilized the notes as collateral for the issuance of asset backed securities to the public. The Capital Corporation and certain foreign subsidiaries also sold retail notes to other financial institutions, receiving proceeds of $5 million in 1993, $242 million in 1992 and $6 million in 1991. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the net unpaid balances of retail notes previously sold were $1,399 million and $697 million, respectively. The company was contingently liable for recourse in the maximum amount of $113 million and $76 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The retail notes sold are collateralized by security interests in the related machinery sold to customers. There is a minimal amount of credit and market risk due to monthly adjustments to the sale price of a small portion of the retail notes. There is no anticipated credit risk related to nonperformance by the counterparties. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, net credit receivables administered, which include credit receivables previously sold but still administered, totaled $5,154 million and $5,092 million, respectively.
The allowance for doubtful credit receivables represented 2.22 percent and 1.99 percent of credit receivables outstanding at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. In addition, at October 31, 1993 and 1992, the company's credit subsidiaries had $119 million and $117 million, respectively, of deposits withheld from dealers and merchants available for potential credit losses. An analysis of the allowance for doubtful credit receivables follows in millions of dollars:
Allowances for doubtful credit receivables are maintained in amounts considered appropriate in relation to the receivables and leases outstanding based on estimated collectibility and collection experience. The lower provisions in 1993 and 1992 resulted from a decrease in write-offs of uncollectible receivables and leases, particularly recreational product related notes and John Deere industrial equipment retail notes. The total ""Provision for doubtful receivables"" is included in the ""Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows"" on pages 22 and 23.
OTHER RECEIVABLES
Other receivables at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
Other receivables are primarily held by the Financial Services subsidiaries. The credit subsidiaries have sold retail notes to limited purpose business trusts which utilized the notes as collateral for the issuance of asset backed securities to the public. The balance of the related receivables is equal to the unamortized present value of deposits made with the trusts pursuant to recourse provisions, and other payments to be received under the sales agreements. Additional information is presented in the ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" on page 36.
EQUIPMENT ON OPERATING LEASES
Operating leases arise from the lease of John Deere equipment to retail customers in the United States and Canada. Initial lease terms range from 12 to 72 months. The net value of John Deere equipment on operating leases was $195 million and $168 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Of these leases, at October 31, 1993, $76 million was financed by the Equipment Operations and $119 million by John Deere Credit Company. The accumulated depreciation on this equipment was $52 million and $53 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The corresponding depreciation expense was $29 million in 1993, $29 million in 1992 and $28 million in 1991.
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled $105 million at October 31, 1993 and are scheduled as follows: 1994--$48, 1995--$34, 1996--$15, 1997--$7 and 1998--$1.
INVENTORIES
Substantially all inventories owned by Deere & Company and its United States equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost on the ""last-in, first-out"" (LIFO) method. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the ""first-in, first-out"" (FIFO) basis, or market. The value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis represented 83 percent and 81 percent of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value on October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Under the LIFO inventory method, cost of goods sold ordinarily reflects current production costs thus providing a matching of current costs and current revenues in the income statement. However, when LIFO-valued inventories decline, as they did in 1993 and 1992, lower costs that prevailed in prior years are matched against current year revenues, resulting in higher reported net income. Benefits from the reduction of LIFO inventories totaled $51 million ($33 million or $.43 per share after income taxes) in 1993, $65 million ($43 million or $.56 per share after income taxes) in 1992 and $128 ($84 million or $1.11 per share after income taxes) in 1991.
Raw material, work-in-process and finished goods inventories at October 31, 1993 totaled $464 million on a LIFO-value basis com-
pared with $525 million one year ago. If all inventories had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31 in millions of dollars would have been as follows:
PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION
Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment additions were $205 million in 1993 compared with $281 million in 1992. Additions for 1993 included $204 million for capital expenditures and $1 million for leased property under capital leases. Additions for 1992 included $279 million for capital expenditures and $2 million for capitalization of interest. Of the 1993 capital expenditures, $161 million were in the United States and Canada, $35 million were overseas and $8 million were incurred by the Financial Services subsidiaries.
A summary of consolidated property and equipment at October 31 in millions of dollars follows:
Leased property under capital leases amounting to $26 million and $29 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, is included primarily in machinery and equipment and all other.
Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant items of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation amounted to $226 million in 1993, $217 million in 1992 and $190 million in 1991. Most of the company's property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method for financial accounting purposes. Depreciation for United States federal income tax purposes is computed using accelerated depreciation methods.
It is not expected that the cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements will have a material effect on the company's financial position or operating results.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Consolidated net intangible assets totaled $297 million and $338 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Equipment Operations' balance of $278 million at October 31, 1993 consisted primarily of $181 million related to the minimum pension liability required by FASB Statement No. 87, and unamortized goodwill which resulted from the purchase cost of assets acquired exceeding their fair value. The intangible pension asset decreased by $34 million during 1993.
Intangible assets, excluding the intangible pension asset, are being amortized over 25 years or less, and the accumulated amortization was $53 million and $47 million at October 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The intangible pension asset is remeasured and adjusted annually.
SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
Short-term borrowings at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
All of the Financial Services short-term borrowings represent obligations of the credit subsidiaries.
Unsecured lines of credit available from United States and foreign banks were $3,344 million at October 31, 1993. Some of these credit lines are available to both the Equipment Operations and certain credit subsidiaries. At October 31, 1993, $2,296 million of the worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, total short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization.
Included in the above lines of credit are three long-term committed credit agreements expiring on various dates through March 1996 in an aggregate maximum amount of $3,276 million. Each agreement is mutually extendable. Annual facility fees on the credit agreements range from 0.125 percent to 0.1875 percent.
Certain of these credit agreements have various requirements of John Deere Capital Corporation, including the maintenance of its consolidated ratio of earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. In addition, the Capital Corporation's ratio of senior debt to total stockholder's equity plus subordinated debt may not be more than 8 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also contain provisions requiring Deere & Company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of $1,600 million according to United States generally accepted accounting principles as of October 31, 1992.
The company's credit subsidiaries have entered into interest rate swap and interest cap agreements to hedge their interest rate exposure in amounts corresponding to a portion of their short-term borrowings. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the total notional principal amounts of interest rate swap agreements were $642 million and $291 million, having rates of 3.6 percent to 10.0 percent, terminating in up to 28 months and 48 months, respectively. The total notional principal amounts of interest rate cap agreements at October 31, 1993 and 1992 were $44 million and $105 million, having capped rates of 8.0 percent to 9.0 percent,
terminating in up to 15 months and 28 months, respectively. The differential to be paid or received on all swap and cap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognized over the lives of the agreements. The credit and market risk under these agreements is not considered to be significant. The estimated fair value and carrying value of these interest rate swap and cap agreements were not significant at October 31, 1993.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES
Accounts payable and accrued expenses at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
LONG-TERM BORROWINGS
Long-term borrowings at October 31 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:
All of the Financial Services long-term borrowings represent obligations of John Deere Capital Corporation.
The Capital Corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements with independent parties that change the effective rate of interest on certain long-term borrowings to a variable rate based on specified United States commercial paper rate indices. The above table reflects the effective year-end variable interest rates relating to these swap agreements. The notional principal amounts and maturity dates of these swap agreements are the same as the principal amounts and maturities of the related borrowings. In addition, the Capital Corporation has interest rate swap agreements corresponding to a portion of their fixed rate long-term borrowings. At October 31, 1993, the total notional principal amount of these interest rate swap agreements was $347 million, having variable interest rates of 3.4 percent to 3.8 percent, terminating in up to 40 months. The Capital Corporation also has interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with medium-term notes. The above table reflects the interest rates relating to these swap and cap agreements. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the total notional principal amounts of these swap agreements were $138 million and $110 million, terminating in up to 42 months and 54 months, respectively. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the total notional principal amounts of these cap agreements were $25 million and $125 million, terminating in up to 22 months and 34 months, respectively. A Swiss franc to United States dollar currency swap agreement is also associated with the Swiss franc bonds in the table. The credit and market risk under these agreements is not considered to be significant.
At October 31, 1993, the total estimated fair value of the company's total long term borrowings was $2,658 million, comprised of $1,162 million for the Equipment Operations and $1,496 million for Financial Services. The corresponding carrying amount of total long-term borrowings was $2,548 million, comprised of $1,069 million for the Equipment Operations and $1,479 million for Financial Services. Fair values of long-term borrowings with fixed rates were based on a discounted cash flow model. Fair values of long-term borrowings that have been swapped to current variable interest rates approximate their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value and carrying value of the Capital Corporation's interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with medium-term notes were not significant at October 31, 1993.
The approximate amounts of the Equipment Operations' long-term borrowings maturing and sinking fund payments required in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 1994--$148, 1995--$18, 1996--$325, 1997-- $84 and 1998--$54. The approximate amounts of John Deere Capital Corporation's long-term borrowings maturing and sinking fund payments required in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 1994--$405, 1995--$633, 1996--$262, 1997--$309 and 1998--$11.
Certain of the company's credit agreements contain provisions requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated tangible net worth according to United States generally accepted accounting principles as of October 31, 1992. Under these provisions, the total consolidated retained earnings balance of $926 million at October 31, 1993 was free of restrictions as to payment of dividends or acquisition of the company's common stock.
LEASES
The company leases certain computer equipment, lift trucks and other property. The present values of future minimum lease payments relating to leased assets deemed to be capital leases as determined from the lease contract provisions are capitalized. Capitalized amounts are amortized over either the lives of the leases or the normal depreciable lives of the leased assets. All other leases are defined as operating leases. Lease expenses relating to operating leases are charged to rental expense as incurred.
At October 31, 1993, future minimum lease payments under capital leases totaled $3 million as follows: 1994--$2, 1995--$1. Total rental expense for operating leases during 1993 was $48 million compared with $53 million in 1992 and $49 million in 1991. At October 31, 1993, future minimum lease payments under operating leases amounted to $85 million as follows: 1994--$30, 1995--$27, 1996--$17, 1997--$4, 1998--$3, later years--$4.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
On October 31, 1993, the company was contingently liable for recourse of approximately $113 million on credit receivables sold to financial institutions or limited purpose business trusts by both the Financial Services subsidiaries and the Equipment Operations. In addition, certain foreign subsidiaries have pledged assets with a balance sheet value of $32 million as collateral for bank advances of $2 million. Also, at October 31, 1993, the company had commitments of approximately $50 million for construction and acquisition of property and equipment.
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability and retail credit matters. The company and certain subsidiaries of the Capital Corporation are currently involved in legal actions relating to alleged violations of certain technical provisions of Texas consumer credit statutes in connection with John Deere Company's financing of the retail purchase of recreational vehicles and boats in that state. These actions include: a class action brought by Russell Durrett individually and on behalf of others against John Deere Company (filed in state court on February 19, 1992 and removed on February 26, 1992 to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division), which case was certified as a class action by the court on November 6, 1992; and a class action titled Deere Credit, Inc. v. Shirley Y. Morgan, et al., originally filed on February 20, 1992, and certified in the 281st Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, on October 12, 1993 for all persons who opt out of the federal class action. The company and the Capital Corporation subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses and intend to defend the actions vigorously. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these unresolved legal actions and the amounts of claimed damages and penalties are large, the company believes that these unresolved legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position.
CAPITAL STOCK
Changes in the common stock account in 1991, 1992 and 1993 were as follows:
In September 1993, the company issued 8,050,000 shares of common stock in a public offering. The net proceeds of $535 million were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the reduction of indebtedness of the Equipment Operations and credit subsidiaries.
The calculation of net income per share is based on the average number of shares outstanding during the year. The calculation of net income per share assuming full dilution recognizes the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of stock appreciation rights and stock options, and conversion of convertible debentures. The calculation also reflects adjustment for interest expense relating to the convertible debentures, net of applicable income taxes.
The company is authorized to issue 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which has been issued.
The major changes during 1993 affecting common stock in treasury included the acquisition of 112,100 shares of treasury stock at a total cost of $6 million. In addition, 70,628 shares of treasury stock at original cost of $4 million were issued under the restricted stock plan.
RESTRICTED STOCK
In 1989, stockholders approved a restricted stock plan for key employees of the company. Under this plan, 750,000 shares may be granted as restricted stock. The company will establish the period of restriction for each award and hold the restricted stock during the restriction period, while the employee will receive any dividends and vote the restricted stock. No award may be made under the plan providing for restrictions that lapse after October 31, 1999.
In February 1993, stockholders approved a restricted stock plan for nonemployee directors. Under this plan, 30,000 shares may be granted as restricted stock. The restrictions lapse when a director retires from the Board.
Under both plans, the market value of the restricted stock at the time of grant is recorded as unamortized restricted stock compensation in a separate component of stockholders' equity. This compensation is amortized to expense evenly over the minimum periods of restriction, which is currently four years for both plans. At October 31, 1993, 444,807 shares remained available for award under both plans.
Changes in the unamortized restricted stock compensation account in 1991, 1992 and 1993 were as follows:
STOCK OPTIONS
Options for the purchase of the company's common stock are issued to officers and other key employees under stock option plans as approved by stockholders. Options outstanding at October 31, 1993 generally become exercisable one year after the date of grant and are exercisable up to 10 years after the date of grant.
The stock option plan includes authority to grant stock appreciation rights, either concurrently with the grant of options or subsequently, and to accept stock of the company in payment for shares under the options. Both incentive options and options not entitled to incentive stock option treatment (nonstatutory options) may be granted under the plan. At October 31, 1993, 4,457,902 shares remained available for the granting of options.
During the last three fiscal years, changes in shares under option were as follows:
For options outstanding at October 31, 1993, the average exercise price was $43.53 per share and expiration dates ranged from December 1993 to December 2002. Of the outstanding options, 261,998 may be exercised in the form of stock appreciation rights.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE AND SAVINGS PLANS
The company maintains the following significant plans for eligible employees:
John Deere Savings and Investment Plan, for salaried employees John Deere Stock Purchase Plan, for salaried employees John Deere Tax Deferred Savings Plan, for hourly and incentive paid employees Company contributions under these plans were $9 million in 1993, $11 million in 1992 and $22 million in 1991.
RETAINED EARNINGS
An analysis of the company's retained earnings follows in millions of dollars:
CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT
An analysis of the company's cumulative translation adjustment follows in millions of dollars:
The company has entered into foreign exchange contracts and options in order to hedge the currency exposure of certain inventory, short-term borrowings and expected inventory purchases.
The foreign exchange contract gains or losses are accrued as foreign exchange rates change, and the contract premiums are amortized over the terms of the foreign exchange contracts. The option premiums and any gains are deferred and recorded as part of the cost of future inventory purchases. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the company had foreign exchange contracts maturing in up to three months and six months for $409 million and $424 million, respectively. At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the company had options maturing in up to 24 months and 36 months for $72 million and $261 million, respectively. The credit and market risk under these agreements is not considered to be significant. At October 31, 1993, the estimated fair value and carrying value of the foreign exchange contracts and options were not significant.
CASH FLOW INFORMATION
For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the company considers investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the company's short-term borrowings mature within three months or less.
Cash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Deere & Company:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related statements of consolidated income and of consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1993. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the index under Part IV, Item 14(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Deere & Company and subsidiaries at October 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective November 1, 1992 the company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

Tesoro Petroleum Corporation, together with its subsidiaries ('Tesoro' or the 'Company'), is a natural resource company engaged in refining and marketing, exploration and production of natural gas, and wholesale marketing of fuel and lubricants. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1968 (a successor by merger to a California corporation incorporated in 1939). For financial information relating to industry segments, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
RECENT EVENTS
In February 1994, the Company completed a recapitalization plan ('Recapitalization') which was approved by the Board of Directors during 1993. Among other things, the Recapitalization included the exchange by holders of $44.1 million principal amount of the Company's 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures ('Subordinated Debentures') for a like amount of new 13% Exchange Notes and the approval by holders of the Company's $2.16 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.16 Preferred Stock') to reclassify such stock (including accrued and unpaid dividends thereon of approximately $9.5 million) into an aggregate of 6,465,859 shares of the Company's Common Stock. In addition, the Company also agreed to issue 131,956 shares of its Common Stock on behalf of the holders of $2.16 Preferred Stock to pay certain of their legal fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of the litigation discussed below.
In connection with the Recapitalization, the Company also entered into an agreement with MetLife Security Insurance Company of Louisiana ('MetLife') ('Amended MetLife Memorandum'), pursuant to which MetLife, the sole holder of the outstanding shares of the Company's $2.20 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.20 Preferred Stock'), agreed, among other things, to waive the annual $2.20 Preferred Stock mandatory redemption requirements, to consider all accrued and unpaid dividends on the $2.20 Preferred Stock as of the effective date of the Recapitalization (aggregating approximately $21.2 million) to have been paid, to allow the Company to pay future dividends on the $2.20 Preferred Stock in Common Stock in lieu of cash, to waive or refrain from the exercise of other rights under the $2.20 Preferred Stock, and to grant the Company a three-year option to purchase all shares of $2.20 Preferred Stock and Common Stock held by MetLife as of the effective date of the Recapitalization for an aggregate option price of $53 million at February 9, 1994, subject to certain adjustments. The unpaid option price will be increased by 3% on the first day of each calendar quarter through December 31, 1995 and by 3 1/2% of the unpaid option price on the first day of each quarter thereafter. Pursuant to the Amended MetLife Memorandum, the Company agreed to issue MetLife 1,900,075 shares of Common Stock at the time of the reclassification of the $2.16 Preferred Stock. Upon shareholders' approval of the Recapitalization, MetLife owned 2,875,000 shares of $2.20 Preferred Stock and 4,084,160 shares of Common Stock, including the 1,900,075 shares of Common Stock issued to MetLife in connection with the Recapitalization.
Consummation of the Recapitalization has improved the short-term and long-term liquidity of the Company and has increased the Company's equity capital. The exchange of the $44.1 million principal amount of Subordinated Debentures will satisfy annual sinking fund requirements on the Subordinated Debentures for approximately four years. The Recapitalization is also intended to improve the financial condition of the Company and allow the Company to continue its new strategy of improving its refining and marketing operations and accelerating its oil and gas exploration and development activities, as discussed in more detail below. For information on the pro forma effects of the Recapitalization, see Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
In October 1993, Croyden Associates, a holder of shares of the Company's $2.16 Preferred Stock, filed a class action suit in Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of itself and all other holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock. The suit alleged that the Company and its directors breached their fiduciary duties to the holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock based on the terms of the proposed recapitalization as described in the Company's Proxy Statement, Prospectus and Consent Solicitation ('Proxy Statement -- Prospectus') as originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 2, 1993, which provided for the reclassification of each share of $2.16 Preferred Stock into 3.5 shares of Common Stock or, at the holder's option, 2.75 shares of Common Stock and .25 share of a new issue of preferred stock. The suit sought, among other things, monetary damages and to enjoin the recapitalization. After Croyden Associates filed the lawsuit, representatives of the Company and representatives of Croyden Associates, including the attorneys for the holders of $2.16 Preferred Stock, had numerous discussions over a period of four months concerning the possible settlement of the litigation. During the course of such discussions, various rates for exchanging the $2.16 Preferred Stock into Common Stock were proposed by the parties, ranging from four shares to six shares of Common Stock for each share of $2.16 Preferred Stock. In addition, the parties discussed the possibility of issuing shares of Common Stock based on the market price for such shares during a period immediately before or after consummation of the Recapitalization. During the course of such discussions, Croyden Associates proposed a fixed rate of five shares of Common Stock per share of $2.16 Preferred Stock and the parties ultimately reached agreement on such rate. Discussions then took place between attorneys for the Company and the attorneys for the holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock with respect to payment of fees and expenses of the attorneys for the holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock, which fees and expenses are the obligations of the holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock, the class benefiting from the services of such counsel. As a result of these discussions, the Company agreed to pay up to $500,000 in cash of the fees and expenses awarded by the Chancery Court, and the attorneys for the holders of the $2.16 Preferred Stock agreed to limit their fee application to $500,000 in cash plus .1 share of Common Stock for each share of $2.16 Preferred Stock. Out of the five shares of Common Stock the Company agreed to issue for each share of $2.16 Preferred Stock, the Company agreed to issue .1 share on behalf of the holders of $2.16 Preferred Stock so that such shares will be available to pay the fees and expenses of such attorneys if awarded by the Chancery Court. On February 4, 1994, Croyden Associates and the Company entered into an agreement seeking court approval of a settlement based upon the terms set forth in the Proxy Statement -- Prospectus. By order dated February 7, 1994, the Delaware Chancery Court scheduled a hearing, to be held on April 13, 1994, to determine whether to approve the terms of the settlement and enter a final judgment dismissing the action.
In March 1994, the Company's Board of Directors authorized management of the Company to investigate the feasibility of a future equity offering of additional shares of the Company's Common Stock together with a future public debt offering. The proceeds from these offerings would be used to finance the Company's option to acquire all of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and $2.20 Preferred Stock held by MetLife and to refinance all or a portion of the Company's outstanding long-term debt.
The Company transports its crude oil and a substantial portion of its refinery products over Kenai Pipe Line Company's ('KPL') pipeline and marine terminal facilities in Nikiski, Alaska. KPL's common carrier pipeline is subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') and the Alaska Public Utilities Commission. On March 1, 1994, KPL filed a revised tariff with the FERC, with a proposed effective date of April 1, 1994, to regulate certain dock loading services KPL had previously provided pursuant to a private contract with the Company which KPL has terminated. KPL's proposed FERC rate for this dock loading service would have increased the Company's annual cost of transporting products through KPL's facilities from $1.2 million to $11.2 million or an increase of $10 million per year. The Company considered the proposed KPL rate clearly excessive and on March 21, 1994, filed a motion to reject or suspend the
rate with the FERC. On March 29, 1994, the FERC rejected KPL's revised tariff; however, under FERC regulations, KPL has the right to file a new tariff.
The Company has recently initiated discussions with KPL to acquire the facilities or an interest therein. In connection therewith, KPL has agreed not to file a new tariff with the FERC for a period of at least 30 days and the Company has agreed to negotiate a rate with KPL for that period. While the Company is unable to predict the purchase price for the facility, or an interest therein, if a purchase with KPL is negotiated, the Company does not believe that any negotiated purchase price will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or liquidity. The Company also cannot predict (i) whether it will ultimately be able to negotiate the acquisition of the facilities or an interest therein, (ii) the rate of any new tariff that may be filed by KPL, or approved by the FERC, if the Company is unable to negotiate an acquisition of the facilities or an interest therein, and (iii) whether any new rate that may be filed by KPL or the ultimate resolution of this matter by the FERC if the Company is unable to negotiate an acquisition of the facilities or an interest therein will have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the Company.
REFINING AND MARKETING
REFINING AND MARKETING
The Company conducts refining operations in Alaska and sells products to a wide variety of customers in Alaska, in the area west of the Rocky Mountains and in certain Far Eastern markets. During 1993, products from the Company's Alaska refinery accounted for approximately 75% of such sales, including products received on exchange in the West Coast market, with the remaining 25% being purchased from other refiners and suppliers.
The refinery, which is located in Kenai, Alaska, has a rated throughput capacity of 72,000 barrels per day and is capable of producing liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil and residual fuel oil. The refinery is designed to process crude oil with a sulphur content of up to 1%. Alaska North Slope ('ANS') and Cook Inlet crude oils, the primary crude oils currently used as feedstock for the refinery, are below this limit. To assure the availability of crude oil to the refinery, the Company has a royalty crude oil purchase contract with the State of Alaska ('State')(see 'Crude Oil Supply' discussed below). During the second quarter of 1993, the Company implemented a market-driven operational strategy for its refining and marketing operations. This strategy includes reducing refinery throughput and upgrading the mix of feedstocks, which is intended to enable the Company to match its refined product yield more closely to the product demand in Alaska, its primary market, and reduce shipments of refined products to less profitable markets. The strategy is also intended to reduce the Company's working capital requirements and reduce the volume of residual fuel oil produced by the Company's Alaska refinery. Implementation of this strategy has resulted in a decrease in total refinery production from 60,900 barrels per day in 1992 to 49,000 barrels per day during 1993, including a decrease in the level of residual fuel oil production from approximately 23,400 barrels per day in 1992 to approximately 17,600 barrels per day during 1993. The Company's ability to further reduce production of residual fuel oil, other than by further reducing total refinery production, is currently limited by the availability of lighter feedstocks and by the configuration of the refinery hardware. There can be no assurance that the new strategy will ultimately prove successful. See 'Government Regulation and Legislation -- Environmental Controls' for a discussion of the effect of governmental regulations on the production of low sulphur diesel fuel for on-highway use in Alaska.
In March 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved the construction of a vacuum processing unit at the refinery. This unit, estimated to cost approximately $24 million, will reduce the amount of residual fuel oil by further processing this product into additional higher-valued products.
During 1993, the refinery processed approximately 72% ANS crude oil, 22% Cook Inlet crude oil and 6% of other refinery feedstocks, which yielded refined products consisting of approximately 25% gasoline, 25% jet fuel, 14% diesel fuel and other distillates and 36% residual fuel oil. Of the refinery production in 1993, the Company distributed approximately 89% of the gasoline to end-users in the State, either by retail sales through 33 of its 7-Eleven convenience store locations, by wholesale sales through 68 branded and 25 unbranded dealers and jobbers or by exchange deliveries to major oil companies, with the remaining 11% being transported to the West Coast. Virtually all of the jet fuel production is marketed in Alaska to commercial airlines through sales or exchange deliveries. Substantially all of the diesel fuel and other distillates production is marketed through exchange deliveries or sales in Alaska. In recent years, sales of residual fuel oil have been increasingly unprofitable. During 1993, under its new marketing strategy, the Company commenced selling and transporting a substantial volume of its residual fuel oil production to customers on the West Coast.
In addition to its own refining capacity, the Company estimates the other refiners in Alaska have the capacity to process approximately 156,000 barrels of crude oil per day, all of which is ANS crude oil. After processing the crude oil and removing the lighter-end products, such as gasoline and jet fuel, which represent approximately 30% of each barrel processed, these refiners are permitted, by paying a fee and because of their proximity to the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, to return the remainder of the processed crude back into the pipeline system as 'return oil.'
During 1993, the production of gasoline by all refiners in Alaska, including the Company, exceeded the market demand by approximately 1,400 barrels per day. The excess production was exported from Alaska, generally during the winter months when the demand for gasoline in Alaska is lowest. The demand for jet fuel in Alaska currently exceeds the production of the refiners in the State, and several marketers, including the Company, import jet fuel into the State to meet this excess demand. The primary market for diesel fuel in Alaska is the commercial fishing fleet. Generally, the production of diesel fuel by refiners in Alaska and the demand for such diesel fuel is in balance; however, because of the high variability of the demand, there are occasions when diesel fuel is imported into or exported from the State. The Company is the only producer in Alaska of residual fuel oil for sale. Since there is no current demand for residual fuel oil in Alaska, the residual fuel oil was exported from the State, primarily to other refiners on the West Coast during 1993, where it was generally used as a refinery feedstock.
The Company conducts domestic wholesale marketing operations primarily in California, Oregon and Washington, with its principal office in Long Beach, California. During 1993, this operation sold approximately 27,800 barrels per day of refined products, of which approximately 30% was received from major oil companies in exchange for refined products from the Company's Alaska refinery, approximately 5% was received directly from the Company's Alaska refinery and the balance was purchased from other suppliers. The Company sells these refined products in the bulk market and through 25 terminal locations, of which four are owned by the Company.
The Company holds an exclusive license agreement for all 7-Eleven convenience stores in Alaska and operates such stores in 39 locations, 33 of which sell Company branded gasoline. During 1993, these convenience stores sold a total of 63,000 gallons of gasoline per day.
The following table summarizes the Company's refinery throughput and product sales for the years ended December 31, 1993, December 31, 1992 and September 30, 1991:
1993 1992 1991 (AVERAGE DAILY BARRELS) Refinery Throughput------------------ 49,753 61,425 68,192 Refining and Marketing Product Sales: Gasoline------------------------- 22,466 25,196 25,883 Jet fuel------------------------- 11,305 19,060 15,055 Other distillates---------------- 18,049 19,253 20,488 Residual fuel oil---------------- 16,945 23,931 28,729 Total------------------------ 68,765 87,440 90,155
CRUDE OIL SUPPLY
The Company has a contract through 1994 with the State which provides for the purchase of certain quantities of the State's Prudhoe Bay North Slope royalty crude oil, based on a percentage of all Prudhoe Bay North Slope royalty crude oil produced. At current levels of Prudhoe Bay production, this contract provides for the purchase of approximately 37,500 barrels per day at the weighted average net-back price of all North Slope producers at Pump Station No. 1. In connection with its anticipated reduction in refinery throughput, effective January 1, 1993, the Company exercised its right under this contract to reduce purchases to approximately 27,500 barrels per day.
The Company's present and certain past contracts with the State contained provisions which would have required the Company to pay the State additional retroactive amounts if the State prevailed in the ANS ROYALTY LITIGATION against the producers of North Slope crude oil ('Producers'). The State settled with each of the Producers, with the last settlement occurring in April 1992. As a result of the settlements between the State and the Producers, the State claimed that the crude oil it sold to the Company and others was undervalued to the extent that the Producers undervalued their oil. The State's claim against the Company amounted to $141.9 million (including interest), of which $44.8 million (the 'Chevron Portion') was reimbursable to the Company under a crude oil purchase/sale agreement with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. ('Chevron').
In January 1993, the Company entered into an agreement with the State ('ANS Agreement') that settled this contractual dispute. The ANS Agreement provided that $97.1 million (which did not include the Chevron Portion) was owed to the State by the Company and that the Company would cooperate with the State in seeking to recover the Chevron Portion. Under the ANS Agreement, the State released the Company from liability for the Chevron Portion.
Under the ANS Agreement, the Company paid the State $10.3 million in January 1993 and agreed to make variable monthly payments to the State over the nine years following the date of the settlement based on a per barrel charge that increases over the nine-year term from 16 cents to 33 cents on the volume of feedstock processed at the Company's Alaska refinery. In 1993, the Company's variable payments to the State totaled $2.6 million. At the end of the nine-year period, the Company is obligated to pay the State $60 million; provided, however, that such payment may be deferred indefinitely by continuing the variable monthly payments to the State beginning at 34 cents per barrel and increasing one cent per barrel annually thereafter. Variable monthly payments made after the nine-year period will not reduce the $60 million obligation to the State. The $60 million obligation is evidenced by a security bond, and the bond and the variable monthly payments are secured by a second mortgage on the Alaska refinery. The Company's obligations under the ANS Agreement and the mortgage may be subordinated to current and future senior debt obligations (including, without limitation, principal, interest and related expenses) of up to $175 million, plus any indebtedness incurred in the future to improve the Alaska refinery. For further information concerning the Company's settlement with the State, see Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Additional ANS crude oil, other than that which is purchased from the State, is acquired by the Company through various purchase and exchange agreements with the Producers. All ANS crude oil is delivered to the refinery by tanker through the Kenai Pipeline Company marine terminal. In addition, the Company obtains available Cook Inlet crude oil, which is delivered by tanker or through an existing pipeline to the refinery. This Cook Inlet crude oil is acquired through term contracts and spot purchases.
From time to time the Company evaluates the economic viability of processing foreign crude oil in its Alaska refinery and occasionally purchases spot quantities to supplement its normal crude oil supply. This foreign crude oil is also delivered to the refinery by tanker through the Kenai Pipeline Company marine terminal.
TRANSPORTATION
The Company charters an American flag vessel, the OVERSEAS WASHINGTON, under an agreement expiring in 1994 with a two-year renewal option. The OVERSEAS WASHINGTON is used primarily to transport North Slope crude oil from the Trans Alaska Pipeline System terminal at Valdez, Alaska to the Company's Alaska refinery. The Company also has a charter for an American flag vessel, the BALTIMORE TRADER, under a six-month agreement expiring in July 1994 with a six-month renewal option remaining. The BALTIMORE TRADER is used primarily to transport residual fuel oil to California and occasionally to transport feedstocks to the Company's Alaska refinery. From time to time, the Company also charters tankers and ocean-going barges to transport petroleum products to its customers within Alaska, on the West Coast and in the Far East.
The Company operates a common carrier petroleum products pipeline from the Company's Alaska refinery to its terminal in Anchorage. This ten-inch diameter pipeline removes the uncertainty of transporting light products in the winter months when icing conditions in the Cook Inlet restrict marine transportation. During 1993, the pipeline transported an average of approximately 22,300 barrels of petroleum products per day, all of which were transported for the Company. The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels of petroleum products per day.
For further information on transportation in Alaska, see 'Government Regulation and Legislation -- Environmental Controls.'
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
UNITED STATES
During 1993, the Company concentrated its activities in the Bob West Field, which is located in the southern part of the Wilcox Trend, Starr and Zapata Counties, Texas. Continued successful development of this field, discovered in 1990, has resulted in net proven natural gas reserves increasing from 74 billion cubic feet at December 31, 1992 to 120 billion cubic feet at December 31, 1993. Fifteen development wells were drilled and completed in this field during 1993, bringing the number of producing wells to 25 at December 31, 1993 with an additional two wells being drilled and one well awaiting completion at year-end. Thirty-nine additional well locations have been selected for further development of this 4,000 acre field, of which 25 are expected to be drilled during 1994. At 1993 year-end, net production from the Bob West Field wells averaged 58 million cubic feet per day. The Company, which does not operate the field, owns an average 50% revenue interest in approximately two-thirds of the field and a 28% revenue interest in the remainder. The Company owns a 70% interest in the central gas processing facility which is currently capable of handling approximately 120 million cubic feet of production per day. The Company owns a 70% interest in Starr County Gathering System's two ten-inch diameter pipelines which transport gas eight miles from the field to common carrier pipeline facilities. In February 1994, the common carrier pipeline facilities were at capacity and production subject to spot market prices was being curtailed. New common carrier pipeline facilities are being constructed by Coastal States Gas Transmission Company which will provide transportation for increased gas production from the Bob West Field in the second quarter of 1994.
In addition to the continued development of the Bob West Field, during 1993 the Company also participated in the drilling of four exploratory wells in other areas of South Texas. The first exploratory well was completed as a producing gas well, the second was a dry hole and, at December 31, 1993, the third was awaiting completion and has subsequently been evaluated as a gas discovery. The fourth well was still being drilled at 1993 year-end but was subsequently evaluated as a dry hole in January 1994. A delineation well, which was drilling at December 31, 1993 on the acreage where the first exploratory well was drilled, was evaluated as a dry hole in January 1994.
Two producing acreage units within the Bob West Field, each consisting of 352 acres, are subject to a gas purchase contract expiring in January 1999 with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company ('Tennessee Gas') pursuant to which Tennessee Gas is currently paying in excess of $7.70 per mcf of gas, which is greatly in excess of the spot market price for natural gas ($2.31 per mcf for the month of December 1993). The gas purchase contract is presently the subject of litigation with Tennessee Gas. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 and Notes K and P of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
BOLIVIA
The Company is the operator of a joint venture which holds two Contracts of Operation with YPFB, the Bolivian state-owned oil and gas company. The Company has a 75% interest in a Contract of Operation, which expires in 2007, covering approximately 93,000 acres in Block XVIII. The Company and its joint venture participant are entitled to receive a quantity of hydrocarbons equal to 40% of the total production, net of Bolivian taxes on production. After payment of taxes on production, YPFB is entitled to the remainder. Under the sales contract with YPFB covering hydrocarbons produced from the La Vertiente, Escondido and Taiguati Fields in this block, the Company and its joint venture participant have contracted to sell approximately 18,000 mcf, after Bolivian taxes, of natural gas per day to YPFB. At December 31, 1993, the Company was receiving $1.25 per mcf for gas sold under this contract. This contract, including the pricing provision, is subject to renegotiation in April 1994 for another two-year period. During 1993, the condensate produced in association with the natural gas was sold to YPFB. The Company's natural gas production from Bolivia as presented in 'Operating Statistics' below represents the Company's net production before Bolivian taxes.
The Company has a 72.6% interest in a Contract of Operation, which expires in 2008, covering approximately 1.2 million acres in Block XX. The Company and its joint venture participant are entitled to receive a quantity of hydrocarbons equal to 50% of the total production, net of Bolivian taxes on production, with YPFB receiving the remainder. Prior to 1993, one successful commercial gas discovery well, the Los Suris No. 1, was drilled on the block and is shut-in pending the approval by the Government of Bolivia of a commercialization agreement. A plan of development for Block XX has been approved by YPFB and the Government of Bolivia. Under the plan of development, the Company drilled a well, the Los Suris No. 2, which was completed in February 1994 and tested gross production potential of approximately 9 million cubic feet of gas per day and approximately 120 barrels of condensate per day from two intervals. The Los Suris No. 2 is also shut-in pending the approval of the commercialization agreement. The plan provides that, in order to postpone the relinquishment of inactive acreage until July 15, 1995, the drilling of a second exploratory well must be completed by September 30, 1994, and the drilling of a third exploratory well must be started no later than the fourth quarter of 1994 and completed by April 30, 1995. The Company may further postpone the relinquishment of inactive acreage until July 15, 1996, by submitting no later than July 1, 1995, an additional two-well drilling program that is acceptable to YPFB. To guarantee the drilling of the first three exploratory wells, in July 1993 the Company submitted a bank guarantee in the amount of $2 million to YPFB for the drilling of the first exploratory well and, prior to the January 15, 1994 deadline, the Company submitted bank guarantees to YPFB in the aggregate amount of $4 million for the drilling of the second and third wells. Since the Los Suris No. 2 has now been completed, YPFB has released the first $2 million guarantee.

OIL FIELD SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
WHOLESALE MARKETING OF FUEL AND LUBRICANTS
The Company sells lubricants, fuels and specialty petroleum products primarily to onshore and offshore drilling contractors. The Company's products are sold through six land terminals and 13 marine terminals located in various cities in Texas and Louisiana. These products are used to power and lubricate machinery on drilling and production locations. The Company also provides products for marine, commercial and industrial applications.
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The Company's environmental remediation products and services operation continues to experience losses and is being evaluated as to its long-term economic viability.
COMPETITION
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all phases, including the refining and marketing of crude oil and petroleum products and the search for and development of oil and gas reserves. This industry also competes with industries that supply the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial, individual and other consumers. The Company competes with a substantial number of major integrated oil companies and other companies having materially greater financial and other resources. These competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of this industry. In addition, unlike the Company, many competitors also produce large volumes of crude oil which may be used in connection with their operations.
OTHER
A portion of the Company's operations are conducted in foreign countries where the Company is also subject to risks of a political nature and other risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company's operations outside the United States in recent years have been, and in the future may be, materially affected by host governments through increases or variations in taxes, royalty payments, export taxes and export restrictions and adverse economic conditions in the foreign countries, the future effects of which the Company is unable to predict.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND LEGISLATION
UNITED STATES
NATURAL GAS REGULATIONS
Historically, all domestic natural gas sold in so-called 'first sales' was subject to federal price regulations under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the 'NGPA'), the Natural Gas Act (the 'NGA'), and the regulations and orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the 'FERC') in implementing such Acts. Under the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, all remaining natural gas wellhead pricing, sales, certificate and abandonment regulation of first sales by the FERC was terminated on January 1, 1993.
The FERC also regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of gas produced by the Company, as well as the revenues received by the Company for sales of such natural gas. Since the latter part of 1985, through its Order Nos. 436, 500 and 636 rulemakings, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis, and the FERC's efforts have significantly altered the marketing and pricing of natural gas. A related effort has been made with respect to intrastate pipeline operations pursuant to the FERC's authority under Section 311 of the NGPA, under which the FERC establishes rules by which intrastate pipelines may participate in certain interstate activities without becoming subject to full NGA jurisdiction. These Orders have gone through various permutations, but have generally remained intact as promulgated. The FERC considers these changes necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with gas buyers than has historically been the case.
The FERC's latest action in this area, Order No. 636, issued April 8, 1992, reflected the FERC's finding that under the current regulatory structure, interstate pipelines and other gas merchants, including producers, do not compete on an equal basis. The FERC asserted that Order No. 636 was designed to equalize that marketplace. This equalization process is being implemented through negotiated settlements in individual pipeline service restructuring proceedings, designed specifically to 'unbundle' those services (e.g., gathering, transportation, sales and storage) provided by many interstate pipelines so that producers of natural gas may secure services from the most economical source, whether interstate pipelines or other parties. In many instances, the result of the FERC initiatives has been to substantially reduce or bring to an end the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only gathering, transportation and storage services for others which will buy and sell natural gas. The FERC has issued final orders in all of the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings and all of the interstate pipelines are now operating under new open access tariffs.
Although Order No. 636 does not regulate gas producers, such as the Company, the FERC has stated that Order No. 636 is intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. It is unclear what impact, if any, increased competition within the natural gas industry under Order No. 636 will have on the Company and its gas marketing efforts. In addition, numerous petitions seeking judicial review of Orders Nos. 636, 636A and 636B and seeking review of FERC's orders approving open access tariffs for the individual pipelines have already been filed. Because the restructuring requirements that emerge from this lengthy process may be significantly different from those of Order No. 636 as originally promulgated, it is not possible to predict what, if any, effect the final rule resulting from Order No. 636 will have on the Company. The Company does not believe, however, it will be affected by any action taken with respect to Order No. 636 any differently than other gas producers and marketers with which it competes.
In late 1993, FERC initiated a proceeding seeking industry-wide comments about its role in regulating natural gas gathering performed by interstate pipelines or their affiliates. Numerous written and oral comments have been received by the FERC concerning whether and how it should
regulate gathering activities, but the Company cannot predict what, if any, action the FERC may take or whether such action will affect access to markets of its gas or its own gas gathering facilities and activities.
The oil and gas exploration and production operations of the Company are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring drilling permits and the maintenance of bonds in order to drill or operate wells; the regulation of the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing of wells and the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; and the plugging and abandoning of wells. The operations of the Company are also subject to various conservation regulations, including regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled in a given area and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of lands and leases. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil, condensate and natural gas the Company can produce from its wells and the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can drill.
More recently, the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement has further streamlined and simplified procedures for the importation and exportation of gas between and among Mexico, the United States and Canada. These changes could provide additional opportunities to export gas to Mexico, but will more likely enhance the ability of Canadian and Mexican producers to export natural gas to the United States, thereby increasing competition in the domestic natural gas market.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective, or their effect, if any, on the Company's operations. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS
Federal, state, area and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment affect all operations of the Company to some degree. One example of a federal environmental law that would require operational additions and modifications is the Clean Air Act, which was amended in 1990. While the Company believes that its facilities generally are in substantial compliance with current regulatory standards for air emissions, over the next several years the Company's facilities may be required to comply with new requirements being adopted and to be promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the 'EPA') and the states in which the Company operates. These regulations may necessitate the installation of additional controls or other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources. At this time, the Company cannot estimate when new standards will be imposed by the EPA or relevant state agencies or what technologies or changes in processes the Company may have to install or undertake to achieve compliance with any applicable new requirements.
The passage of the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 prompted adoption of regulations by the State obligating the Company to produce oxygenated gasoline for delivery to the Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska markets starting on November 1, 1992. Controversies surrounding the potential health effects in arctic regions of oxygenated gasoline containing methyl tertiary butyl ether ('MTBE') prompted the early discontinuance of the program in Fairbanks in December 1992. On October 21, 1993, the United States Congress granted the State one additional year of exemption from requiring the use of oxygenated gasoline. However, state and local officials may still require the use of these fuels at their option. In addition, the EPA has been directed to conduct additional studies
of potential health effects of oxygenated fuel in Alaska. Additional federal regulations promulgated on August 21, 1990, and scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1993, set limits on the quantity of sulphur in on-highway diesel fuels which the Company produces. The State filed an application with the federal government in February 1993 for a waiver from this requirement since only 5% of the diesel fuel sold in Alaska is for on-highway vehicles. The EPA supported the State's position and the formalities for obtaining the exemption were completed on September 27, 1993. The EPA, in a letter to the State dated September 30, 1993, indicated that the EPA was completing the final documentation regarding the waiver and that Alaska would have a low priority for enforcement of the diesel fuel regulations, pending the publication of the final decision. The Company estimates that substantial capital expenditures would be required to enable the Company to produce low-sulphur diesel fuel to meet these federal regulations. If the State is unable to obtain a waiver from the federal regulations, the Company would discontinue the sales of diesel fuel for on-highway use. The Company estimates that such sales accounted for less than 1% of its refined product sales in Alaska during 1993. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters; however, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on the Company's operations.
Regulations promulgated by the EPA on September 23, 1988, require that all underground storage tanks used for storing gasoline or diesel fuel either be closed or upgraded not later than December 22, 1998, in accordance with standards set forth in the regulations. The Company's service stations subject to the upgrade requirements are limited to locations within the State of Alaska, the majority of which are located in non-residential areas. Although the Company continues to monitor, test and make physical improvements in its current operations which result in a cleaner environment, the Company was not required to make any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 1993. The Company may be required to make significant expenditures for removal or upgrading of underground storage tanks at several of its current and former service station locations by December 22, 1998; however, the Company does not expect to make any material capital expenditures for such purposes during 1994 and 1995 and does not expect that such expenditures subsequent to 1995 will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. See Legal Proceedings, Item 3(e).
The Company currently charters a vessel to transport crude oil from the Valdez, Alaska pipeline terminal through Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet to its Alaska refinery. In addition, the Company routinely charters, on a term or spot basis, additional tankers and barges for the shipment of crude oil and refined products through Cook Inlet. The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires, as a condition of operation, that the Company submit an oil spill contingency plan for its Alaska refinery terminal facility located on Cook Inlet that demonstrates the capability to respond to the 'worst case discharge' to the maximum extent practicable. Alaska law requires a contingency plan for that terminal providing for containment or control, and cleanup, within 72 hours, of a spill equal to the volume of the terminal's largest storage tank. With respect to the charter vessels employed by the Company to transport crude oil through Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet to the Company's Alaska refinery, federal and Alaska law both require contingency plans as a condition of navigation. The Company has obtained State approval for its Cook Inlet Oil Discharge Contingency Plan and conditional approval, which allows operations pending final State review, for a Tanker Spill Prevention and Response Plan for Prince William Sound. The federal plan must demonstrate the capability to respond to the 'worst case discharge' to the maximum extent practicable, while the Alaska plan must be based on containment or control, and cleanup, of a 50,000 barrel discharge within 72 hours. To meet those standards, the Company has entered into a contract with Alyeska Pipeline Service Company ('Alyeska') to provide the initial spill response services in Prince William Sound with the Company to assume those responsibilities after mutual agreement with Alyeska and the State and Federal On-Scene Spill Response Coordinators. The Alaska legislature passed legislation in 1992, providing limited immunity for spill response contractors, which has facilitated access to contract extensions that will not be dependent on further legislative action. The Company has also entered into an agreement with Cook Inlet Spill Prevention & Response Inc. for oil spill response services in
Cook Inlet. The Company believes these contracts provide the additional services necessary to meet the spill response requirements established by Alaska and federal law.
For further information regarding environmental matters, see Legal Proceedings in Item 3.
BOLIVIA
The Company's operations in Bolivia are subject to the Bolivian General Law of Hydrocarbons and various other laws and regulations. The General Law of Hydrocarbons imposes certain limitations on the Company's ability to conduct its operations in Bolivia. In the Company's opinion, neither the General Law of Hydrocarbons nor other limitations imposed by governmental laws, regulations and practices will have a material adverse effect upon its Bolivian operations.
TAXES
UNITED STATES
The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 imposed a new 4.3 cents per gallon 'transportation fuels tax' effective October 1, 1993, and a tax on commercial aviation fuel effective October 1, 1995. The Company does not believe such taxes will have a material adverse effect on the Company's future operations.
BOLIVIA
The Company is subject to Bolivian taxation at the rate of 30% of the gross production of hydrocarbons at the wellhead which is retained and paid by YPFB for the Company's account. In 1987, the Bolivian General Corporate Income Tax Law was replaced by a tax system, including a Value Added Tax, which is not imposed on net income. As a result, it is uncertain whether or not the Company can treat the Bolivian hydrocarbons tax as creditable in the United States for federal income tax purposes. However, due to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards, the Company does not now, or in the near future, expect to use these taxes as credits for federal income tax purposes.
In 1990, the Bolivian Government passed a new General Law of Hydrocarbons containing provisions designed to ensure the creditability, for United States federal income tax purposes, of these hydrocarbon taxes if the Company makes an election which may subject it to a higher Bolivian tax rate in the future. Regulations under this new law have not been issued; however, the Company does not anticipate that this new law will have a material effect on the Company's Bolivian operations.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 1993, the Company employed approximately 900 persons, of which approximately 40 employees are located in foreign countries. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union for collective bargaining purposes. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT
The following is a list of the Company's executive officers, their ages and their positions with the Company as of March 1, 1994.

Officers are elected annually by the Board of Directors at its first meeting following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each to hold office until the corresponding meeting of the Board in the next year or until his successor shall have been elected or shall have qualified.
All of the Company's executive officers have been employed by the Company or its subsidiaries in an executive capacity for at least the past five years, except for those named below who have had the business experience indicated during that period. Positions, unless otherwise specified, are with the Company.
ITEM 2.",,,"ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
See information appearing under Item 1, Business herein and Schedules V and VI of Financial Statement Schedules in Item 14.
ITEM 3.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
(a) The Company is selling gas from its Bob West Field to Tennessee Gas under a 1979 Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement ('Gas Contract') which expires in January 1999. The Gas Contract provides that the price of gas shall be the maximum price as calculated in accordance with the then effective Section 102 (b) (2) ('Contract Price') of the NGPA.
In August 1990, Tennessee Gas filed a civil action in the District Court of Bexar County, Texas against the Company and several other companies, seeking a Declaratory Judgment that the Gas Contract is not applicable to the Company's properties. Tennessee Gas claimed, among other things, that certain leases covered by the Gas Contract had terminated and therefore were automatically released from the Gas Contract, eliminating the obligation of Tennessee Gas to purchase gas from the Company. Tennessee Gas also challenged the quantity of gas which can be sold under the Gas Contract and contended that the gas sales price was to be calculated under the provisions of Section 101 of the NGPA rather than the Contract Price. At December 31, 1993, the Section 101 price of $5.01 per mcf was $2.71 per mcf less than the Contract Price, but $2.75 per mcf above spot market prices.
On June 24, 1992, the District Court trial judge returned a verdict in favor of the Company. The District Court's judgment, entered on July 8, 1992, ruled that Tennessee Gas must honor the Gas Contract pursuant to its terms. Tennessee Gas filed a motion for reconsideration in the District Court on the issue of the price to be paid for the gas under the Gas Contract, which was denied by the court. On September 11, 1992, Tennessee Gas appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District of Texas. On August 25, 1993, the Court of Appeals affirmed the validity of the Gas Contract as to the Company's properties and held that the price payable by Tennessee Gas for the gas was the Contract Price. The Court of Appeals determined, however, (i) that the trial court erred in its summary judgment ruling that the Gas Contract was not an output contract under the Texas Business and Commerce Code ('TBCA') and (ii) that a fact issue exists as to whether the increases in the volumes of gas tendered to Tennessee Gas under the Gas Contract were made in bad faith or were unreasonably disproportionate to prior tenders in contravention of the provisions of Section 2.306 of the TBCA. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals directed that this issue be remanded to the trial court in Bexar County, Texas. The Company filed a motion for
rehearing with the appellate court regarding its decision that the Gas Contract creates an output contract governed by the TBCA. Tennessee Gas also filed a motion for rehearing with the appellate court regarding the portions of its decision upholding the judgment of the trial court. On January 26, 1994, the appellate court rendered its judgment denying all motions for rehearing in this matter and affirming its earlier ruling. The Company has appealed the appellate court ruling on the output contract issue to the Supreme Court of Texas. Tennessee Gas has also appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas that portion of the appellate court ruling denying the remaining Tennessee Gas claims. If the Supreme Court of Texas does not grant the Company's petition for writ of error and affirms the appellate court ruling, then the only issue for trial will be whether the increases in the volumes of gas tendered to Tennessee Gas from the Company's properties may have been made in bad faith or were unreasonably disproportionate. Management of the Company believes its tenders were reasonable under the Gas Contract and the market conditions at the time and will vigorously defend on this issue if put to trial. The Company continues to receive payment from Tennessee Gas based on the Contract Price.
Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, management believes that the Tennessee Gas claims are without merit and, based upon advice from outside legal counsel, is confident that the decision of the trial court will ultimately be upheld as to the validity of the Gas Contract and the Contract Price; and that with respect to the output contract issue, the Company believes that, if this issue is tried, the development of its gas properties and the resulting increases in volumes tendered to Tennessee Gas will be found to have been reasonable and in good faith. Accordingly, the Company has recognized revenues, net of production taxes and marketing charges, for natural gas sales through December 31, 1993, under the Gas Contract based on the Contract Price, which net revenues aggregated $16.8 million more than the Section 101 prices and $31.0 million in excess of the spot market prices. An adverse judgment in this case could have a material adverse effect on the Company. If Tennessee Gas ultimately prevails in this litigation, the Company could be required to return to Tennessee Gas $31.0 million, excluding any interest that may be awarded by the court, representing the difference between the spot price for gas and the Contract Price.
(b) In March 1991, the Company entered into a Consent Order with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation ('ADEC'), substantially similar to the Consent Orders reached with the EPA in September 1989. These Consent Orders provide for the investigation and cleanup of hydrocarbons in the soil and groundwater at the Company's Alaska refinery which resulted from sewer hub seepage associated with the underground oil/water sewer system. The Consent Orders formalized efforts, which commenced in 1987, to remedy the presence of hydrocarbons in the soil and groundwater and provide for the performance of additional future work. The Company has replaced or rebuilt the drainage hubs and has initiated a subsurface monitoring and interception system designed to identify the extent of hydrocarbons present in the groundwater and to remove the hydrocarbons. The Company estimates that annual expenditures of approximately $1.5 million will be required in the future to operate these subsurface monitoring and interception systems, the majority of which will be covered by insurance through 1995.
(c) In March 1992, the Company received a Compliance Order and Notice of Violation ('Notice') from the EPA alleging possible violations by the Company of the New Source Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act at its Alaska refinery. The Notice alleges that the Company (i) failed to install a fuel gas combustion monitoring device by October 2, 1991; (ii) failed to keep documentation on two storage vessels reflecting quantities of petroleum liquid stored, the period of storage and the maximum true vapor pressure of the liquid stored; (iii) failed to submit documentation on two gas turbines (a) verifying the accuracy of the monitoring system for recording fuel consumption and ratio of fuel to water being fired in the
turbines and (b) monitoring sulphur and nitrogen content of the fuel being fired in the turbines; (iv) failed to conduct a monitoring and repair program under the Standards for Equipment Leaks of Volatile Organic Compounds with respect to one of the refinery units; and (v) failed to (a) equip the Company's south bulk gasoline terminal with a vapor recovery system, (b) assure the loading of liquid products into tanks with a compatible vapor collection system, and (c) conduct performance tests and submit subsequent written reports to the EPA to determine compliance with vapor collection systems installed at the Company's south bulk terminal. The EPA has the statutory authority to assess civil penalties for the alleged violations of up to $25,000 per day for each violation, but the EPA has not assessed a penalty against the Company for its alleged violations to date. The Company is continuing in its efforts to resolve these issues with the EPA; however, no final resolution has been reached. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business or financial condition.
(d) The Company has been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party ('PRP') pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ('CERCLA') for the D.L. Mud, Inc. ('Mud') and Gulf Coast Vacuum Services ('Gulf Coast') Superfund sites in Abbeville, Louisiana. These sites are contiguous and at one time were owned by the same company. Over 100 parties have been identified as PRPs for these sites. The Company arranged for the disposal of a minimal amount of materials at these locations. CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on PRPs; each PRP is therefore responsible for 100% of the costs of the response actions necessary to remediate the sites in the event a settlement with the EPA cannot be reached. The EPA is seeking reimbursement for its response costs incurred to date at each site, as well as a commitment from PRPs either to conduct future remedial activities or to finance such activities.
The EPA has completed its investigation of the Gulf Coast site to determine the type and extent of contamination. The EPA issued the Record of Decision and sent out notice letters to PRPs. The Company has entered into a DE MINIMIS settlement with the EPA at the Gulf Coast site. The Company's total liability under the settlement was $2,500.
One of the larger PRPs in the Mud site has taken the lead in investigating the site to determine the extent of contamination. Initial technical reports have been reviewed by the EPA and are undergoing further preparation; however, the reports are not yet available. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the extent of the Company's liability related to the Mud site; however, based on its settlement in the Gulf Coast site, the Company believes that the aggregate amount of such liability, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
(e) In September 1990, the Company was identified by the Department of Environmental Resources of Stanislaus County, California ('DER') as a responsible party for hydrocarbon contamination present at a service station location formerly leased and operated by the Company. In February 1993, the DER demanded that the Company and three other entities named as responsible parties undertake action to remediate the contamination. The owner of the location, Briggsmore Plaza Co. ('Briggsmore'), instituted litigation in the California state court seeking compensation from the Company for damages resulting from the contamination. Also named as a defendant was a third party which became the operator of the service station in 1985, and which filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws a short time after the lawsuit commenced. In November 1993, a settlement agreement was entered into by the Company and Briggsmore, which provides that the Company will assume responsibility for the management and expense of remediating the location in accordance with DER requirements. It is estimated that remediation to closure will cost the Company $300,000 to $500,000. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay Briggsmore approximately $48,000,
representing past-due rent and property taxes. Briggsmore has released all claims against the Company except the remediation obligations arising under the settlement agreement.

The selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7","ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
In 1993, the Company achieved significant improvement in profitability resulting primarily from the implementation of a market-driven operational strategy along with favorable industry conditions in its refining and marketing segment; higher natural gas production resulting from concentration on the development of the Bob West Field; and a reduction of general and administrative expenses. The improvement in profitability together with the completion of a recapitalization plan during February 1994, as discussed below, have improved the Company's liquidity and enhanced its capital resources.
During February 1994, the Company completed a plan of recapitalization (the 'Recapitalization'), the purpose of which was to improve the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity and increase the Company's equity capital. The Recapitalization, which deferred $44 million of debt service requirements and increased stockholders' equity by approximately $80 million, has provided the Company greater financial flexibility to meet its near-term capital expenditure programs and finance working capital, which are expected to further enhance the Company's operating results.
Significant components of the Recapitalization, which will be recorded in February 1994, are as follows:
* 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures ('Subordinated Debentures') in the principal amount of $44.1 million were tendered in exchange for a like amount of new 13% Exchange Notes ('Exchange Notes'), which will satisfy approximately four years of sinking fund requirements for the Subordinated Debentures. The Exchange Notes bear interest at 13% and will mature on December 1, 2000.
* The 1,319,563 outstanding shares of $2.16 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.16 Preferred Stock') of the Company, together with accrued and unpaid dividends of $9.5 million at February 9, 1994, were reclassified into 6,465,859 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The Company also agreed to issue 131,956 shares of Common Stock on behalf of the holders of $2.16 Preferred Stock to pay certain of their legal fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of litigation.
* The agreement between the Company and MetLife Security Insurance Company of Louisiana ('MetLife'), the holder of all the Company's outstanding $2.20 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.20 Preferred Stock'), was amended with regard to such preferred shares to waive all existing mandatory redemption requirements, to consider all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (aggregating approximately $21.2 million as of February 9, 1994) to have been paid, to allow the Company to pay future dividends in Common Stock in lieu of cash, to waive or refrain from exercising other rights of the $2.20 Preferred Stock and to grant to the Company an option to purchase during the next three years all shares of the $2.20 Preferred Stock and Common Stock held by MetLife for approximately $53 million (amount at February 9, 1994, increasing by 12% to 14% annually), all in consideration for, among other things, the issuance by the Company to MetLife of 1,900,075 shares of Common Stock. Such additional shares will be subject to the option granted by MetLife. The Company will be required to pay dividends when due on the $2.20 Preferred Stock in order for the option to remain outstanding.
The following table presents the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 1993 as reported and on a pro forma basis assuming the Recapitalization had occurred on that date (in millions):

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Board of Directors and Stockholders Tesoro Petroleum Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesoro Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations, common stock and other stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, December 31, 1992 and September 30, 1991 and for the three-month period ended December 31, 1991. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tesoro Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, December 31, 1992 and September 30, 1991 and for the three-month period ended December 31, 1991, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 1992 the Company changed its methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and accounting for income taxes.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Tesoro Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively the 'Company' or 'Tesoro') after elimination of significant intercompany balances and transactions. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1993 presentation.
Effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its fiscal year-end from September 30 to December 31. Unless otherwise indicated, the information contained herein addresses the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993, compared to the year ended December 31, 1992 and the year ended September 30, 1991 and its financial condition as of December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992. The results of operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 1991 are discussed separately.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. During 1992, the Company began investing in short-term debt securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days. These investments are classified as short-term investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash equivalents and short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value. For information regarding restricted cash, see Note I.
INVENTORIES
The Company follows the lower of cost (last-in, first-out basis -- LIFO) or market method for valuing inventories of crude oil and wholesale refined products. All other inventories are valued principally at the lower of cost (generally on a first-in, first-out or weighted average basis) or market.
FUTURES AND OPTIONS HEDGE CONTRACTS
The Company uses commodity futures and options contracts primarily to hedge the impact of price fluctuations on anticipated purchases of crude oil. Gains and losses on commodity futures and options hedge contracts are deferred until recognized in income when the related crude oil is charged to costs of sales.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The Company uses the full-cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs associated with property acquisition and exploration and development activities are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country-by-country basis. For each cost center, the capitalized costs are subject to a limitation so as not to exceed the present value of future net revenues from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves net of income tax effect plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the cost center. Capitalized costs within a cost center, together with estimates of costs for future development, dismantlement and abandonment, are amortized on a unit-of-production method using the proved oil and gas reserves for each cost center. The Company's investment in certain oil and gas properties is excluded from the amortization base until the properties are evaluated. No gain or loss is recognized on the sale of oil and gas properties except in the case of the sale of properties involving significant remaining reserves. Proceeds from the sale of insignificant reserves and undeveloped properties are applied to reduce the costs in the cost centers.
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Assets recorded under capital leases have been capitalized in accordance with promulgations from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Amortization of such assets is recorded over the shorter of lease terms or useful lives under methods which are consistent with the Company's depreciation policy for owned assets.
Depreciation of other property is provided using primarily the straight-line method with rates based on the estimated useful lives of the properties and with an estimated salvage value of 20% for refinery assets and generally 10% for other assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the respective lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever period is less.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
The Company accounts for postretirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions' ('SFAS No. 106'). The projected future cost of providing postretirement benefits other than pensions, such as health care and life insurance, are expensed as employees render service instead of when benefits are paid. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 106, the Company had expensed these benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 106, effective January 1, 1992, resulted in a net charge of $21.6 million, or $1.54 per share, for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for periods prior to 1992, which were not restated. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an increase of $1.2 million, or $.09 per share, in the 1992 net loss before cumulative effect of accounting changes.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes' ('SFAS No. 109'). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 effective January 1, 1992 by recognizing a net benefit of $1.0 million, or $.07 per share, for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. Periods prior to 1992 were not restated. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 did not have a significant effect on 1992 results of operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES
Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the Company's commitment to a formal plan of action.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Deferred compensation represents the excess of market value over the sales price of restricted common stock awarded to certain employees of the Company. The deferred compensation is being amortized over the period from the date of award to the dates the shares become unrestricted (the period for which the payment for services is being made).
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Primary earnings (loss) per share is calculated on net earnings (loss) after deducting dividend requirements on preferred stocks and is based on the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Fully diluted earnings (loss) per share is the same as primary earnings (loss) per share since the assumed conversion of preferred stocks to common shares would be anti-dilutive.
NOTE B -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT -- RECAPITALIZATION
In February 1994, the Company consummated exchange offers and adopted amendments to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to which the Company's outstanding debt and preferred stock were restructured (the 'Recapitalization'). The objectives of the Recapitalization were to improve the Company's financial condition, facilitate the development of long-term financing and allow the Company to execute its strategy for further improving its refining and marketing operations and accelerating the development of its South Texas natural gas field.
The significant components of the Recapitalization, together with the applicable accounting effects, are as follows:
* The Company offered to exchange up to $54.5 million aggregate principal amount of new 13% Exchange Notes ('Exchange Notes') due December 1, 2000 for a like amount of 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures ('Subordinated Debentures') due March 15, 2001. Holders of $44.1 million principal amount of Subordinated Debentures accepted this offer resulting in the issuance of $44.1 million of Exchange Notes. This exchange will satisfy approximately four years of sinking fund requirements of the Subordinated Debentures.
The exchange of the Subordinated Debentures will be accounted for as an early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 1994 and the Company will recognize a charge of $4.8 million as an extraordinary loss on this transaction, representing the excess of the estimated market value of the Exchange Notes over the carrying value of the Subordinated Debentures. The carrying value of the Subordinated Debentures exchanged has been reduced by applicable unamortized debt issue costs. No tax benefit is available to offset the extraordinary loss as the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance to the extent of its deferred tax assets.
* Each outstanding share of the Company's $2.16 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.16 Preferred Stock'), which has a $25 per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends aggregating $9.5 million at February 9, 1994, was reclassified into 4.9 shares of the Company's Common Stock resulting in the issuance of 6,465,859 of the Company's Common Stock in 1994. In addition, the Company agreed to issue .1 share of Common Stock for each share of $2.16 Preferred Stock, or an aggregate of 131,956 shares of Common Stock, on behalf of the holders of $2.16 Preferred Stock to pay certain of their legal fees and expenses in connection with the settlement of litigation.
The issuance of the Common Stock in connection with the reclassification and settlement of litigation will be recorded in 1994 as an increase of approximately $1 million in Common Stock equal to the aggregate par value of the Common Stock to be issued and an increase in Additional Paid-In Capital of approximately $9 million.
* The agreement between the Company and MetLife Security Insurance Company of Louisiana ('MetLife'), the holder of the Company's outstanding $2.20 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.20 Preferred Stock'), was amended with regard to the $2.20 Preferred Stock to waive all existing mandatory redemption requirements, to consider all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (aggregating $21.2 million at February 9, 1994) to have been paid, to allow
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED the Company to pay future dividends on such Preferred Stock in Common Stock in lieu of cash, to waive or refrain from exercising other rights of the $2.20 Preferred Stock, and to grant to the Company an option to purchase, during the next three years, all shares of the $2.20 Preferred Stock and Common Stock held by MetLife for approximately $53 million (amount at February 9, 1994, increasing by 12% to 14% annually), all in consideration for, among other things, the issuance by the Company to MetLife of 1,900,075 shares of Common Stock. Such additional shares will be subject to the option granted by MetLife. These actions have resulted in the reclassification of the $2.20 Preferred Stock into equity capital at its aggregate liquidation preference of $57.5 million and the recording of an increase in Additional Paid-In Capital of approximately $21 million in February 1994.
The following table presents the capitalization of the Company as of December 31, 1993 as reported and on a pro forma basis assuming the Recapitalization had occurred on that date (in millions):

NOTE D -- INVENTORIES
Inventories valued by the LIFO method amounted to approximately $63.0 million and $63.7 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. At December 31, 1993, inventories valued using LIFO approximated replacement cost. At December 31, 1992 inventories valued using LIFO were lower than replacement cost by approximately $9.6 million.
NOTE E -- PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Effective May 1, 1992, the Company's subsidiaries, Tesoro Indonesia Petroleum Company and Tesoro Tarakan Petroleum Company (collectively 'Tesoro Indonesia'), sold their 100% interest in
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED two separate contracts of operations with Pertamina, the state-owned petroleum company of Indonesia. The sales included all of Tesoro Indonesia's interests in fixtures, wells, pipelines, tanks, compressors, rigs and other equipment in the contract areas, and inventories of crude oil and materials and supplies. The consideration received by Tesoro Indonesia totaled $6.6 million in cash and the assumption by the purchaser of liabilities of approximately $6.3 million and all remaining expenditure commitments. During 1992, these sales transactions resulted in pretax net gains to the Company of approximately $5.8 million after related expenses.
In 1992, the Company sold its corporate airplane and related assets for $3.3 million in cash with no significant pretax gain to the Company. The Company also sold certain oil and gas properties in South Texas for $2.1 million in cash, which proceeds reduced the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties and no gain or loss was recognized. In addition, the Company sold its remaining drilling rigs for cash proceeds of $1.6 million resulting in a pretax loss of $1.1 million during 1992.
NOTE F -- INVESTMENT IN TESORO BOLIVIA PETROLEUM COMPANY
The Company's subsidiary, Tesoro Bolivia Petroleum Company ('Tesoro Bolivia'), holds an interest in a joint venture agreement to explore for and produce hydrocarbons in Bolivia. The joint venture has an agreement with the Bolivian Government and YPFB, the Bolivian state-owned oil company, for collection of receivables for sales of natural gas and condensate to YPFB, which in turn sells the natural gas to the Republic of Argentina. The agreement provided, among other things, that receipts from natural gas sales subsequent to December 31, 1987 would be placed in a restricted bank account ('Restricted Account') from which only payments for investments and expenses in Bolivia could be made until April 1992, or until cumulative deposits to the Restricted Account equal $90.0 million. Cumulative deposits to the Restricted Account have totaled $90.0 million and receipts for natural gas sales are now free of restrictions to the joint venture. The increase in the book value of this investment during 1993 represented earnings and cash invested in Tesoro Bolivia reduced by cash received free of restrictions.
NOTE G -- ACCRUED LIABILITIES
The Company's current accrued liabilities as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following (in thousands):

The income tax provision includes the following (in thousands):
During 1993, the Company resolved several outstanding issues with state taxing authorities resulting in a reduction of $3.0 million in state income tax expense and $5.2 million in related interest expense.
Deferred income taxes and benefits are provided for differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Temporary differences and the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized as follows (in thousands):

TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The following table sets forth the components of the Company's results of operations and a reconciliation of the normal statutory federal income tax with the provision for income taxes (in thousands):
At December 31, 1993, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $71.1 million for regular tax and approximately $56.1 million for alternative minimum tax. These tax loss carryforwards are available for future years and, if not used, will begin to expire in the year 2004. Also at December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately $8.2 million of investment tax credits and employee stock ownership credits available for carryover to subsequent years. These credits, if not used, will begin to expire in the year 2001.
If the Company has an 'ownership change' as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Company's use of its net operating loss carryforwards and general business credits after such ownership change will be subject to an annual limit. Under certain interpretations of existing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, the Recapitalization, as discussed in Note B, will result in an ownership change. The Company intends to take the position that an ownership change under existing law did not occur prior to the Recapitalization and did not occur as a result thereof. Because there are substantial interpretive questions concerning such IRS regulations and there is uncertainty as to events which may occur after the Recapitalization, there can be no assurance that an ownership change did not occur as a result of the Recapitalization or will not occur as a result of future events. If an ownership change is ultimately deemed to have occurred at the time of the Recapitalization, the Company's use of its net operating loss carryforwards and general business credits would be limited to approximately $14.5 million per year.
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
NOTE I -- LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS
Long-term debt and other obligations consist of the following (in thousands):
DECEMBER 31, 1993 1992 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures due 2001-------------------------------- $ 98,154 107,510 Liability to State of Alaska--------- 61,666 71,989 Liability to Department of Energy---- 13,194 13,194 Exploration and Production Loan------ 5,000 -- Industrial Revenue Bonds------------- 2,752 3,483 Capital Lease Obligations (interest at 11%)---------------------------- 3,934 4,368 Other-------------------------------- 772 1,204 185,472 201,748 Less Current Portion----------------- 4,805 26,287 $ 180,667 175,461
Based on the closing market price, the fair value of the Subordinated Debentures, exclusive of accrued interest, was approximately $108.3 million at December 31, 1993. The carrying value of the other long-term debt and obligations approximated the Company's estimate of the fair value of such items.
As discussed in Note B, approximately four years of sinking fund requirements on the Subordinated Debentures will be satisfied by the exchange offer included in the Recapitalization. After giving effect to the Recapitalization, sinking fund requirements and aggregate maturities of long-term debt and obligations for each of the five years following December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):
LETTER OF CREDIT REQUIREMENTS
On October 29, 1993, the Company elected to terminate its secured Letter of Credit Facility Agreement ('Credit Facility') dated July 27, 1989, which was scheduled to expire in March 1994 and which provided for the issuance of up to $40 million in letters of credit at the date of termination. In the latter half of 1993, the Company negotiated several interim credit arrangements collateralized by either cash or inventory to permit the Company to secure the purchases of crude oil feedstocks and to meet other operating and corporate credit requirements. With respect to these interim credit arrangements, the Company has entered into several uncommitted letter of credit facilities which provide for the issuance of letters of credit on a cash-secured basis. Total availability pursuant to the uncommitted letter of credit arrangements was in excess of $80 million.
At December 31, 1993, the Company had arranged for the issuance of $25 million of outstanding letters of credit which were secured by restricted cash deposits. At 1992 year-end, under the terms of the previous Credit Facility, the Company was required to maintain a minimum $30 million cash balance and specified levels of equity and working capital.
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In addition, effective September 30, 1993, the Company entered into a waiver and substitution of collateral agreement ('Substitution Agreement') with the State of Alaska, the Company's largest supplier of crude oil. Under the Substitution Agreement, the Company has pledged the capital stock of Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Company ('Tesoro Alaska'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and substantially all of its crude oil and refined product inventory in Alaska to secure its purchases of royalty crude oil. The Substitution Agreement has allowed the Company to reduce its letter of credit requirements to $25 million as of December 31, 1993. This agreement extends through January 1, 1995 and contains various covenants and restrictions customary to inventory financing transactions.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION FINANCING
Effective October 29, 1993, Tesoro Exploration and Production Company ('Tesoro E&P'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $30 million reducing revolving credit facility ('E&P Facility') secured by the capital stock of Tesoro E&P and its natural gas properties in the Bob West Field in South Texas. At December 31, 1993, $5.0 million was outstanding under this facility.
The E&P Facility, which expires December 31, 1996, is guaranteed by the Company, contains certain financial covenants that must be maintained by Tesoro E&P and bears interest at prime plus 1% or, at Tesoro E&P's option, Libor plus 2.5%. The E&P Facility contains restrictions that prohibit borrowings under the facility to be used by Tesoro E&P or the Company for debt service, including interest and principal on the Company's 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures, or for payment of common or preferred dividends.
12 3/4% SUBORDINATED DEBT AND 13% EXCHANGE NOTES
In 1983, the Company issued $120 million of 12 3/4% Subordinated Debentures at a price of 84.559% of the principal amount, due March 15, 2001. The debentures are redeemable at the option of the Company at 100% of principal amount plus accrued interest. Sinking fund payments sufficient to retire $11.25 million principal amount of debentures annually commenced on March 15, 1993. The Company satisfied the initial sinking fund requirement by purchasing $11.25 million principal amount of debentures at market value on January 26, 1993. The exchange of $44.1 principal amount of Subordinated Debentures for Exchange Notes in February 1994 will satisfy nearly four years of sinking fund requirements (see Note B). At December 31, 1993 and 1992, subordinated debt amounted to $98.2 million (net of discount of $10.6 million) and $107.5 million (net of discount of $12.5 million), respectively. The indenture contains restrictions on payment of dividends on the Company's common stock and purchases or redemptions of common or preferred stocks. Due to losses which have been incurred, the Company must generate approximately $131 million of future net earnings applicable to common stock or from the issuance of capital stock before future dividends can be paid on common stock or before purchases or redemptions can be made of common or preferred stocks.
As part of the Recapitalization discussed in Note B, in February 1994, Subordinated Debentures in the principal amount of $44.1 million were exchanged for a like amount of new 13% Exchange Notes. The Exchange Notes mature on December 1, 2000, and have no sinking fund requirements. The Exchange Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at 100% of principal amount plus accrued interest except that no optional redemption may be made unless an equal principal amount of, or all the outstanding, Subordinated Debentures, are concurrently redeemed. The Exchange Notes rank PARI PASSU with the other senior debt of the Company and with the Subordinated Debentures, and senior in right of payment of the obligation to the State of Alaska (discussed below) and all other subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture governing the Exchange Notes contains
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED limitations on dividends which are less restrictive than the limitation under the Subordinated Debentures. For information on the pro forma effects of the exchange, see Note B.
STATE OF ALASKA
In January 1993, the Company and its subsidiary, Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Company ('Tesoro Alaska'), entered into an agreement ('Agreement') with the State of Alaska ('State') that settled Tesoro Alaska's contractual dispute with the State. In addition to $62 million accrued through September 30, 1992, a charge of $10.5 million for the settlement was included in the Company's operations during the fourth quarter of 1992.
Under the Agreement, Tesoro Alaska paid the State $10.3 million in January 1993 and agreed to make variable monthly payments to the State over the next nine years following the date of the settlement based on a per barrel charge that increases over the nine-year term from 16 cents to 33 cents on the volume of feedstock processed at the Company's Alaska refinery. In 1993, the Company's variable payments to the State totaled $2.6 million. At the end of the nine-year period, Tesoro Alaska is obligated to pay the State $60 million; provided, however, that such payment may be deferred indefinitely by continuing the variable monthly payments to the State beginning at 34 cents per barrel and increasing one cent per barrel annually thereafter. Variable monthly payments made after the nine-year period will not reduce the $60 million obligation to the State. The imputed rate of interest used by the Company on the $60 million obligation was 13%. The $60 million obligation is evidenced by a security bond, and the bond and the throughput barrel obligations are secured by a second mortgage on the Company's Alaska refinery. Tesoro Alaska's obligations under the Agreement and the mortgage are subordinated to current and future senior debt of up to $175 million plus any indebtedness incurred in the future to improve the Company's Alaska refinery.
The State's claim against Tesoro Alaska arose out of certain provisions in present and past contracts with the State that required Tesoro Alaska to pay the State additional retroactive amounts if the State prevailed in litigation against the producers of North Slope crude oil ('Producers'). As a result of settlements between the State and the Producers, the State claimed that the royalty oil it sold Tesoro Alaska and others was undervalued to the extent that the Producers undervalued their oil.
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
A Consent Order entered into by the Company with the Department of Energy ('DOE') in 1989 settled all issues relating to the Company's compliance with federal petroleum price and allocation regulations from 1973 through decontrol in 1981. The Company has paid $41.3 million to the DOE since 1989. The Company's remaining obligation is to pay $13.2 million, exclusive of interest at 6%, over the next eight years.
INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS AND OTHER
The industrial revenue bonds mature in 1998 and require semiannual payments of approximately $365,000. The bonds bear interest at a variable rate (4 1/2% at December 31, 1993) which is equal to 75% of the National Bank of Alaska's prime rate. The bonds are collateralized by the Company's Alaska refinery sulphur recovery unit which had a carrying value of approximately $6.9 million at December 31, 1993.
CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The Company is the lessee of certain buildings and equipment under capital leases with remaining lease terms of 4 to 25 years. These buildings and equipment are used in the Company's convenience store operations in Alaska. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED the present value of the minimum lease payments. Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 1993 included assets held under capital leases of $6.0 million with a net book value of $2.6 million.
NOTE J -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
RETIREMENT PLAN
For all eligible employees, the Company provides a qualified noncontributory retirement plan. Plan benefits are based on years of service and compensation. It is the Company's policy to fund costs accrued to the extent such costs are tax deductible. The components of net pension expense (income) for the Company's retirement plan are presented below (in thousands):
YEARS ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 1992 1991 Service Costs------------------------ $ 931 717 762 Interest Cost------------------------ 3,513 3,492 3,482 Actual Return on Plan Assets--------- (5,695) (1,763) (7,646) Net Amortization and Deferral-------- 1,488 (2,231) 3,167 Net Pension Expense (Income)----- $ 237 215 (235)
For the three months ended December 31, 1991, net pension expense for the Company's retirement plan totaled $90,000.
In addition to the retirement plan pension expense above, during 1992 the Company recognized a curtailment gain of $1.0 million for employee terminations in conjunction with a cost reduction program.
The funded status of the Company's retirement plan and amounts included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are set forth in the following table (in thousands):
DECEMBER 31, SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 1992 1991 Actuarial Present Value of Benefit Obligation: Vested benefit obligation-------- $ 41,200 34,806 33,959 Accumulated benefit obligation--------------------- $ 43,694 36,460 35,556 Plan Assets at Fair Value------------ $ 40,718 39,326 39,772 Projected Benefit Obligation--------- 48,700 40,989 40,305 Plan Assets Less Than Projected Benefit Obligation----------------- (7,982) (1,663) (533) Unrecognized Net Loss---------------- 11,997 7,222 5,889 Unrecognized Prior Service Costs----- (518) (588) (779) Unrecognized Net Transition Asset---- (6,883) (8,120) (9,664) Accrued Pension Expense Liability---------------------- $ (3,386) (3,149) (5,087)
Retirement plan assets are primarily comprised of common stock and bond funds. Actuarial assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 included a discount rate of 7% and a compensation increase rate of 4 1/2%. At December 31, 1992, the discount rate used was 9% and the compensation increase rate used was 6%. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9% for 1993 and 1992.

EXECUTIVE SECURITY PLAN
The Company's executive security plan ('ESP') provides executive officers and other key personnel with supplemental death or retirement benefits in addition to those benefits available under the Company's group life insurance and retirement plans. These supplemental retirement benefits are provided by a nonqualified, noncontributory plan and are based on years of service and compensation. Funding is provided based upon the estimated requirements of the plan. The components of net pension expense for the ESP are presented below (in thousands):
YEARS ENDED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 1992 1991 Service Costs------------------------ $ 426 293 581 Interest Cost------------------------ 291 353 546 Actual Return on Plan Assets--------- (256) (1,004) (628) Net Amortization and Deferral-------- 295 994 590 Net Pension Expense-------------- $ 756 636 1,089
For the three months ended December 31, 1991, net pension expense for the ESP totaled $242,000.
During 1993 and 1992, the Company incurred additional ESP expense of $.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, for settlement losses and other benefits resulting from a cost reduction program, other employee terminations and sales of assets.
The funded status of the ESP and amounts included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are set forth in the following table (in thousands):
DECEMBER 31, SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 1992 1991 Actuarial Present Value of Benefit Obligation: Vested benefit obligation-------- $ 2,394 2,410 6,368 Accumulated benefit obligation--------------------- $ 2,792 2,464 6,420 Plan Assets at Fair Value------------ $ 3,139 2,924 6,658 Projected Benefit Obligation--------- 3,069 2,738 6,420 Plan Assets in Excess of Projected Benefit Obligation----------------- 70 186 238 Unrecognized Net Loss---------------- 1,177 1,409 2,147 Unrecognized Prior Service Costs----- 619 679 1,287 Unrecognized Net Transition Obligation------------------------- 1,110 1,254 2,412 Prepaid Pension Asset------------ $ 2,976 3,528 6,084
Assets of the ESP consist of a group annuity contract. Actuarial assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 included a discount rate of 7% and a compensation rate increase of 4 1/2%. At December 31, 1992, the discount rate used was 9% and the compensation rate increase used was 5%. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9% for 1993 and 1992.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides health care and life insurance benefits to retirees and eligible dependents who were participating in the Company's group insurance program at retirement. These benefits are provided through unfunded defined benefit plans. The
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED health care plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The life insurance plan is noncontributory.
As discussed in Note A, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 effective January 1, 1992 and incurred a net charge of $21.6 million ($16.1 million for health care benefits and $5.5 million for life insurance benefits) for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. The components of net periodic postretirement benefits expense, other than pensions, for 1993 and 1992 included the following (in thousands):
Prior to 1992, the costs of providing health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees were expensed as claims were paid. In 1991, the costs of providing retirees with health care benefits amounted to $751,000 and life insurance benefits amounted to $299,000. For the three months ended December 31, 1991, retiree health care and life insurance benefits totaled $191,000 and $59,000, respectively.
The Company continues to fund the cost of postretirement health care and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The following table shows the status of the plans reconciled with the amounts in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):
The weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed to be 12% for 1994 decreasing gradually to 7% by the year 2010 and remains at that level thereafter. This health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the obligation and periodic cost reported. For example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1993 by $2.9 million and the aggregate of service cost and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefits for the year then ended by $.4 million.
Actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 included a discount rate of 7% and a compensation rate increase of 4 1/2%. At December 31, 1992, the discount rate was 8 1/2% and the compensation rate increase was 6%.
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
THRIFT PLAN
The Company's employee thrift plan provides for contributions by eligible employees into designated investment funds with a matching contribution by the Company of 50% of the employee's basic contribution. The Company's contributions amounted to $482,000, $474,000 and $439,000 during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 1991, the Company's contributions amounted to $107,000.
COST REDUCTION PROGRAM AND OTHER EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS
In addition to the ESP settlement losses and other benefits and the retirement plan curtailment gain discussed above, during 1992 the Company incurred charges of $6.6 million for expenses to implement a cost reduction program and other employee terminations.
NOTE K -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASES
The Company has various noncancellable operating leases related to convenience stores, equipment, property, vessels and other facilities. Lease terms range from one year to 40 years and generally contain multiple renewal options. Future minimum annual payments for operating leases, as of December 31, 1993, are as follows (in thousands):
1994--------------------------------- $ 17,157 1995--------------------------------- 4,946 1996--------------------------------- 3,860 1997--------------------------------- 3,265 1998--------------------------------- 3,125 Thereafter--------------------------- 13,885 Total---------------------------- $ 46,238
Total rental expense was approximately $32.5 million, $24.3 million and $19.9 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Rental expense for 1993, 1992 and 1991 included $22.9 million, $12.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, related to the lease of vessels used to transport crude oil to or refined products from the Company's Alaska refinery. The lease for one of these vessels extends through October 1994 with a renewal option available through October 1996. The lease for the second vessel extends through July 1994 with a renewal option available through January 1995. For the three months ended December 31, 1991, rental expense amounted to $6.0 million, of which $2.9 million related to the lease of a vessel.
GAS PURCHASE AND SALES CONTRACT
The Company is selling gas from its Bob West Field to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company ('Tennessee Gas') under a 1979 Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement ('Gas Contract') which expires in January 1999. The Gas Contract provides that the price of gas shall be the maximum price as calculated in accordance with the then effective Section 102(b)(2) ('Contract Price') of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ('NGPA').
In August 1990, Tennessee Gas filed a civil action in the District Court of Bexar County, Texas against the Company and several other companies, seeking a Declaratory Judgment that the Gas Contract is not applicable to the Company's properties. Tennessee Gas claimed, among other things, that certain leases covered by the Gas Contract terminated and therefore were automatically released from the Gas Contract, eliminating the obligation of Tennessee Gas to purchase gas from the
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Company. Tennessee Gas also challenged the quantity of gas which can be sold under the Gas Contract and contended that the gas sales price was to be calculated under the provisions of Section 101 of the NGPA rather than the Contract Price. At December 31, 1993, the Section 101 price of $5.01 per mcf was $2.71 per mcf less than the Contract Price, but $2.75 per mcf above spot market prices.
On June 24, 1992, the District Court trial judge returned a verdict in favor of the Company. The District Court's judgment, entered on July 8, 1992, ruled that Tennessee Gas must honor the Gas Contract pursuant to its terms. Tennessee Gas filed a motion for reconsideration in the District Court on the issue of the price to be paid for the gas under the Gas Contract, which was denied by the court. On September 11, 1992, Tennessee Gas appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District of Texas. On August 25, 1993, the Court of Appeals affirmed the validity of the Gas Contract as to the Company's properties and held that the price payable by Tennessee Gas for the gas was the Contract Price. The Court of Appeals determined, however, (i) that the trial court erred in its summary judgment ruling that the Gas Contract was not an output contract under the Texas Business and Commerce Code ('TBCA') and (ii) that a fact issue exists as to whether the increases in the volumes of gas tendered to Tennessee Gas under the Gas Contract were made in bad faith or were unreasonably disproportionate to prior tenders in contravention of the provisions of Section 2.306 of the TBCA. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals directed that this issue be remanded to the trial court in Bexar County, Texas. The Company filed a motion for rehearing with the appellate court regarding its decision that the Gas Contract creates an output contract governed by the TBCA. Tennessee Gas also filed a motion for rehearing with the appellate court regarding the portions of its decision upholding the judgment of the trial court. On January 26, 1994, the appellate court rendered its judgment denying all motions for rehearing in this matter and affirming its earlier ruling. The Company has appealed the appellate court ruling on the output contract issue to the Supreme Court of Texas. Tennessee Gas has also appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas that portion of the appellate court ruling denying the remaining Tennessee Gas claims. If the Supreme Court of Texas does not grant the Company's petition for writ of error and affirms the appellate court ruling, then the only issue for trial will be whether the increases in the volumes of gas tendered to Tennessee Gas from the Company's properties may have been made in bad faith or were unreasonably disproportionate. Management of the Company believes its tenders were reasonable under the Gas Contract and the market conditions at the time and will vigorously defend on this issue if put to trial. The Company continues to receive payment from Tennessee Gas based on the Contract Price.
Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, management believes that the Tennessee Gas claims are without merit and, based upon advice from outside legal counsel, is confident that the decision of the trial court will ultimately be upheld as to the validity of the Gas Contract and the Contract Price; and that with respect to the output contract issue, the Company believes that, if this issue is tried, the development of its gas properties and the resulting increases in volumes tendered to Tennessee Gas will be found to have been reasonable and in good faith. Accordingly, the Company has recognized revenues, net of production taxes and marketing charges, for natural gas sales through December 31, 1993, under the Gas Contract based on the Contract Price, which net revenues aggregated $16.8 million more than the Section 101 prices and $31.0 million in excess of the spot market prices. An adverse judgment in this case could have a material adverse effect on the Company. If Tennessee Gas ultimately prevails in this litigation, the Company could be required to return to Tennessee Gas $31.0 million, excluding any interest that may be awarded by the court, representing the difference between the spot price for gas and the Contract Price. For further information concerning the effect of the Gas Contract on certain of the Company's revenues and cash flows, see Note P.

OTHER
In March 1992, the Company received a Compliance Order and Notice of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ('EPA') alleging possible violations by the Company of the New Source Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act at its Alaska refinery. The Company is continuing in its efforts to resolve these issues with the EPA; however, no final resolution has been reached. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business or financial condition.
The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites. The Company is currently involved with two waste disposal sites in Louisiana at which it has been named a potentially responsible party under the Federal Superfund law. Although this law might impose joint and several liability upon each party at any site, the extent of the Company's allocated financial contribution to the cleanup of these sites is expected to be limited based on the number of companies and the volumes of waste involved. At each site, a number of large companies have also been named as potentially responsible parties and are expected to cooperate in the cleanup. The Company is also involved in remedial response and has incurred cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of other sites including certain of its own properties.
At December 31, 1993, the Company had accrued $6.2 million for environmental costs. Based on currently available information, including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions, the Company believes these accruals are adequate. Conditions which require additional expenditures may exist for various Company sites, including, but not limited to, the Company's refinery, service stations (current and closed locations) and petroleum product terminals, and for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The amount of such future expenditures cannot presently be determined by the Company.
NOTE L -- REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
In March 1983, the Company sold 2,875,000 shares of a series of redeemable preferred stock at $20 per share. The stock is held by MetLife which is a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The class of stock, of which there were 2,875,000 shares authorized, issued and outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992, has been designated the $2.20 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.20 Preferred Stock'). This series has one vote per share, is convertible into .8696 shares of Common Stock for each share of Preferred Stock, has a stated value of $1 per share and a liquidation price of $20 per share plus accrued dividends. The $2.20 Preferred Stock ranks in parity with the $2.16 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock as to liquidation and dividends.
The redeemable preferred stock was recorded at fair value on the date of issuance less issue costs. The excess of the redemption value over the carrying value is being accreted by periodic charges to retained earnings over the life of the issue. During 1993 and 1992, the carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock was increased for mandatorily redeemable accumulated dividends, not declared or paid, by charges to retained earnings. As of December 31, 1993, dividends in arrears on the $2.20 Preferred Stock amounted to approximately $19.8 million, or $6.87 1/2 per share.
As discussed in Note B, in February 1994, the agreement between the Company and MetLife was amended with regard to such preferred shares to waive all existing mandatory redemption requirements, to consider all accrued and unpaid dividends (aggregating $21.2 million at February 9, 1994) to have been paid, to allow the Company to pay future dividends in Common Stock in lieu of cash, to waive or refrain from exercising other rights of the $2.20 Preferred Stock and to grant to the
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Company an option to purchase, during the next three years, all shares of the $2.20 Preferred Stock and Common Stock held by MetLife for approximately $53 million (amount at February 9, 1994, increasing by 12% to 14% annually) subject to certain conditions, in consideration for, among other things, the issuance by the Company to MetLife of 1,900,075 shares of Common Stock. Such additional shares will be subject to the option granted by MetLife. After giving effect to the Recapitalization, MetLife's Common and Preferred Stock holdings approximated 27% of the Company's voting securities. For information on the pro forma effects of these amendments, see Note B.
NOTE M -- COMMON STOCK AND OTHER STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
For information regarding the effects of the Recapitalization on the Company's Common Stock and Other Stockholders' Equity, refer to Note B.
$2.16 CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
The Company has designated a class of preferred stock, of which there were 1,319,563 shares outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and 200,000 shares reserved for the granting of options under a stock option plan of the Company. This class, designated the $2.16 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ('$2.16 Preferred Stock'), has voting rights, is convertible into Common Stock at the rate of 1.7241 shares of Common Stock for each share of Preferred Stock, has a stated value of $1 per share and a liquidation value of $25 per share, and is repurchasable at the option of the Company at liquidation value plus accrued dividends. The $2.16 Preferred Stock ranks in parity with the $2.20 Preferred Stock as to liquidation and dividends.
During 1993 and 1992, the liability for accumulated dividends, not declared or paid, on the $2.16 Preferred Stock was accrued by charges to retained earnings. As of December 31, 1993, dividends in arrears on the $2.16 Preferred Stock amounted to approximately $8.9 million, or $6.75 per share.
As discussed in Note B, in February 1994, the outstanding shares of the Company's $2.16 Preferred Stock, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (aggregating $9.5 million at February 9, 1994), were reclassified into shares of the Company's Common Stock.
AMENDED INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN OF 1982 ('1982 PLAN')
The Company's 1982 Plan provides for the granting of stock incentives in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards to officers and key employees. The stock options are exercisable in accordance with the option plans and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
Stock appreciation rights are exercisable in three to five annual installments, normally beginning with the first anniversary date of the grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant. The stock appreciation rights entitle the employee to receive, without payment to the Company, the incremental increase in market value of the related stock from date of grant to date of exercise, payable in cash. Related compensation expense is charged to earnings over periods earned. During 1993, 1992 and 1991 and the three months ended December 31, 1991, no compensation expense was recognized since the market value of the Company's Common Stock remained below the exercise price.
Stock awards totaling 83,015 common shares, 100,000 common shares and 12,000 common shares were granted at par value to certain employees of the Company in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Related compensation expense is charged to earnings over the periods that the shares are earned and amounted to $572,000, $142,000, $135,000 and $28,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991 and the three months ended December 31, 1991, respectively.
TESORO PETROLEUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
At December 31, 1993 and 1992 and September 30, 1991, the Company had 60,002, 392,566 and 852,381 unoptioned shares, respectively, available for granting of options, rights and awards under the 1982 Plan and 6,064,809, 6,084,809 and 6,093,231 shares of unissued Common Stock, respectively, reserved for conversion of preferred stock and the 1982 Plan. During 1988, an amendment to the 1982 Plan was approved which increased the number of shares of Common Stock which may be granted or transferred from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000. The additional shares will be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994. The 1982 Plan expires on February 24, 1994 as to issuance of options, rights and awards; however, grants made before such date that have not been fully exercised will remain outstanding pursuant to their terms.
A summary of activity in the 1982 Plan and a prior plan is set forth below:
EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (THE '1993 PLAN')
On February 9, 1994, the Company's shareholders approved the 1993 Plan which permits the issuance of awards in a variety of forms, including restricted stock, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and performance share and performance unit awards. The 1993 Plan provides for the grant of up to 1,250,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock and, unless earlier terminated, will expire as to the issuance of awards on September 15, 2003. No grants have been made pursuant to the 1993 Plan.
PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
In November 1985, the Company's Board of Directors declared a distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each share of the Company's Common Stock. Each right will entitle the holder to buy 1/100 of a share of a newly authorized Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $35 per right. The rights become exercisable on the tenth day after public announcement that a person or group has acquired 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock. The rights may be redeemed by the Company prior to becoming exercisable by action of the Board of Directors at a redemption price of $.05 per right. If the Company is acquired by any person after the rights become exercisable, each right will entitle its holder to purchase stock of the acquiring company having a market value of twice the exercise price of each right. At December 31, 1993, there were 14,089,236 rights outstanding which will expire in December 1995. In conjunction with the Recapitalization in 1994 discussed in Note B, the Company issued an additional 8,365,934 rights.

NOTE O -- QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)
The 1993 second and fourth quarters included benefits of $3.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, for resolution of several state tax issues. A $5.0 million charge for an inventory erosion was recorded in the 1993 third quarter. Included in the 1993 fourth quarter, however, was a $5.7 million offset to the inventory adjustment taken earlier in the year. Inventory levels at the 1993 year-end were greater than projected earlier in the year due to changing market conditions. The 1993 fourth quarter benefited from the decline in crude oil prices, while the Company's refined product margins held steady or improved.
The 1992 first quarter included charges of $20.6 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, $2.4 million for a cost reduction program and $1.0 million for asset write-downs. The 1992 third quarter included a $5.8 million gain from the sales of the Company's Indonesian operations. The fourth quarter of 1992 included revenues and operating profit of $5.4 million ($.38 per share) resulting from a change in estimate of the Company's revenues from natural gas production in the South Texas field (see Note K) and additional charges of $10.5 million for the settlement with the State of Alaska and $5.6 million for the cost reduction program and other employee terminations.

The following table sets forth the computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves and the changes in such cash flows in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 ('SFAS No. 69'). The standardized measure is the estimated excess future cash inflows from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs, estimated future income taxes and a discount factor. Future cash inflows represent expected revenues from production of year-end quantities of proved reserves based on year-end prices and any fixed and determinable future escalation provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. Escalation based on inflation, federal regulatory changes and supply and demand are not considered. Estimated future production costs related to year-end reserves are based on year-end costs. Such costs include, but are not limited to, production taxes and direct operating costs. Inflation and other anticipatory costs are not considered until the actual cost change takes effect. Estimated future income tax expenses are computed using the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. Consideration is given for the effects of permanent differences, tax credits and allowances. A discount rate of 10% is applied to the annual future net cash flows after income taxes.
The methodology and assumptions used in calculating the standardized measure are those required by SFAS No. 69. The standardized measure is not intended to be representative of the fair market value of the Company's proved reserves. The calculations of revenues and costs do not necessarily represent the amounts to be received or expended by the Company.
As indicated in Note K, certain of the Company's South Texas production activities are involved in litigation pertaining to a natural gas sales contract with Tennessee Gas. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, based upon advice from outside legal counsel, management believes that the Company will ultimately prevail in this dispute. Accordingly, the Company has based its calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on the Contract Price which it is currently receiving. However, if Tennessee Gas were to prevail, the impact on the Company's future revenues and cash flows would be significant. Based on the Contract Price, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves in the United States at December 31, 1993 was $103 million compared to $59 million at spot market prices.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
The following estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves are based on evaluations prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (except for estimates of reserves at December 31, 1991 for properties in Bolivia and for all periods for properties in Indonesia, which estimates were prepared by the Company's in-house engineers). Reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Accounting Standards Board, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except by contractual arrangements.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. The Company's* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products and services.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND CLASSES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS
Incorporated herein by reference is the footnote entitled ""Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information"" of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Abbott Laboratories Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 1993 (""1993 Annual Report""), filed as an exhibit to this report. Also incorporated herein by reference is the text and table of sales by class of similar products included in the section of the 1993 Annual Report captioned ""Financial Review.""
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
PHARMACEUTICAL AND NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS
Included in this segment is a broad line of adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals. These products are sold primarily on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals. The segment also includes agricultural and chemical products, bulk pharmaceuticals, and consumer products.
Principal pharmaceutical and nutritional products include the anti-infectives clarithromycin, sold in the United States under the trademark Biaxin-R- and outside the United States primarily under the trademark Klacid-R- and tosufloxacin, sold in Japan under the trademark Tosuxacin-TM-; various forms of the antibiotic erythromycin, sold primarily as PCE-R- or polymer-coated erythromycin, Erythrocin-R-, and E.E.S.-R-; agents for the treatment of epilepsy, including Depakote-R-; a broad line of cardiovascular products, including Loftyl-R-, a vasoactive agent sold outside the United States; Hytrin-R-, used as an anti-hypertensive and for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia; Abbokinase-R-, a thrombolytic drug; Survanta-R-, a bovine derived lung surfactant; various forms of prepared infant formula, including Similac-R-, Isomil-R-, and Alimentum-R-; and other medical and pediatric nutritionals, including Ensure-R-, Ensure Plus-R-, Jevity-R-, Glucerna-R-, Advera-TM-, PediaSure-R-, Pedialyte-R- and Gain-R-. Consumer products include the dandruff shampoo Selsun Blue-R-; Murine-R- eye care and ear care products; Tronolane-R- hemorrhoid medication; and Faultless-R- rubber sundry products. Agricultural and chemical products include plant growth regulators, including ProGibb-R-; herbicides; larvicides, including Vectobac-R-; and biologically derived insecticides, including DiPel-R- and XenTari-R-.
Pharmaceutical and nutritional products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, health care facilities, and government agencies. In most cases, they are distributed from Company-owned distribution centers or public warehouses. Certain products are co-marketed with other companies. In certain overseas countries, some of these products are marketed and distributed through distributors. Primary marketing efforts for pharmaceutical and nutritional products are directed toward securing the prescription or recommendation of the Company's brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. Managed care purchasers, for example health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and pharmacy benefit managers, are becoming increasingly important customers. Competition is generally from other broad line and specialized health care manufacturers. A significant aspect of competition is the search for technological innovations. The - ------------------------ * As used throughout the text of this Report, the term ""Company"" refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.
introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed has increased competitive pressures on pharmaceutical products.
Consumer products are promoted directly to the public by consumer advertising. These products are generally sold directly to retailers and wholesalers. Competitive products are sold by other diversified consumer and health care companies. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, scientific innovation, price, and availability of generic product forms.
Agricultural and chemical products are generally sold to agricultural distributors and pharmaceutical companies. Competition is primarily from large chemical and agricultural companies and companies selling specialized agricultural products. Competition is based on numerous factors depending on the market served. Important competitive factors include product performance for specialized industrial and agricultural uses, price, and technological advantages.
The Company is the leading worldwide producer of the antibiotic erythromycin. Similac-R- is the leading infant formula product in the United States.
Under an agreement between the Company and Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. of Japan (Takeda), TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TAP), owned 50 percent by the Company and 50 percent by Takeda, develops and markets in the United States products based on Takeda research. TAP markets Lupron-R-, an LH-RH analog, and Lupron Depot-R-, a sustained release form of Lupron-R-, in the United States. These agents are used for the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty. The Company also has marketing rights to certain Takeda products in select Latin American markets. The Company also markets Lupron-R-, Lupron Depot-R-, and Lupron Depot-Ped-R- in select markets outside the United States.
HOSPITAL AND LABORATORY PRODUCTS
Hospital and laboratory products include diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, and alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration equipment, including electronic drug delivery systems; drugs and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.
The principal products included in this segment are parenteral (intravenous or I.V.) solutions and related administration equipment sold as the LifeCare-R- line of products, LifeShield-R- sets, and Venoset-R- products; irrigating fluids; parenteral nutritionals such as Aminosyn-R- and Liposyn-R-; Plum-R- and Omni-Flow-R- electronic drug delivery systems; Abbott Pain Management Provider-R-; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems; venipuncture products; hospital injectables; premixed I.V. drugs in various containers; ADD-Vantage-R- and Nutrimix-R- drug and nutritional delivery systems; anesthetics, including Pentothal-R-, isoflurane, and enflurane; hemodynamic monitoring equipment; Calcijex-R-, an injectable agent for treatment of bone disease in hemodialysis patients; critical care products including Opticath-R-; screening tests for hepatitis B, HTLV-1, hepatitis B core, and hepatitis C; tests for detection of AIDS antibodies and antigens, and other infectious disease detection systems; tests for determining levels of abused drugs with the ADx-R- instrument; physiological diagnostic tests; cancer monitoring tests including tests for prostate specific antigen; laboratory tests and therapeutic drug monitoring systems such as TDx-R-; clinical chemistry systems such as Abbott Spectrum-R-, Abbott Spectrum-R- EPx-R-, Abbott Spectrum-R- CCx-TM-, and Quantum-TM-; Commander-R- and IMx-R- lines of diagnostic instruments and chemical reagents used with immunoassay diagnostics; Abbott Vision-R-, a desk-top blood analyzer, the Abbott TestPack-R- system for diagnostic testing, and a full line of hematology systems and reagents known as the Cell-Dyn-R- series. The hospital and laboratory products the Company expects to introduce in the United States in 1994 include: AxSym-TM-, a diagnostic system; Abbott Maestro-TM-, a data management system; and EnCounter-R-, a desktop hematology analyzer.
The Company markets hospital and laboratory products in the United States and many other countries. These products are generally distributed to wholesalers and directly to hospitals, laboratories, and physicians' offices from distribution centers maintained by the Company. Sales are
also made in the home infusion services market directly to patients receiving treatment outside the hospital through marketing arrangements with hospitals and other health care providers. Overseas sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.
The hospital and laboratory products industry segment is highly competitive, both in the United States and overseas. This segment is subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost effectiveness and productivity gains. Products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence. The Company has benefitted from technological advantages of certain of its current products; however, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.
The Company is one of the leading domestic manufacturers of I.V. and irrigating solutions and related administration equipment, parenteral nutritional products, anesthesia products, and drug delivery systems. It is also the worldwide leader in in vitro diagnostic products, including thyroid tests, therapeutic drug monitoring, cancer monitoring tests, diagnostic tests for the detection of hepatitis and AIDS antibodies, and immunodiagnostic instruments.
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN GENERAL
SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
The Company purchases, in the ordinary course of business, necessary raw materials and supplies essential to the Company's operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and overseas. There have been no recent availability problems or significant supply shortages.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES
The Company is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. The Company owns, has applications pending for, and is licensed under a substantial number of patents. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for the Company's products in the United States and all countries of major marketing interest to the Company. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 and 2. These, and various patents which expire during the period 1994 to 2011, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of the Company's business. However, the Company believes that no single patent, license, trademark, (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks) is material in relation to the Company's business as a whole.
SEASONAL ASPECTS, CUSTOMERS, BACKLOG, AND RENEGOTIATION
There are no significant seasonal aspects to the Company's business. The incidence of certain infectious diseases which occur at various times in different areas of the world does, however, affect the demand for the Company's anti-infective products. Orders for the Company's products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to the Company's business. No single customer accounted for sales equaling 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated net sales. No material portion of the Company's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company spent $880,974,000 in 1993, $772,407,000 in 1992, and $666,336,000 in 1991 on research to discover and develop new products and processes and to improve existing products and processes. The Company continues to concentrate research expenditures in pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. The Company's capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in
1993 were approximately $32 million and $31 million, respectively. Capital and operating expenditures for pollution control are estimated to approximate $39 million and $36 million, respectively, in 1994.
The Company is participating as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigation and/ or remediation at eight locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. The aggregate costs of remediation at these sites by all identified parties are uncertain but have been subject to widely ranging estimates totaling as much as several hundred million dollars. In many cases, the Company believes that the actual costs will be lower than these estimates, and the fraction for which the Company may be responsible is anticipated to be considerably less and will be paid out over a number of years. The Company expects to participate in the investigation or cleanup at these sites. The Company is also voluntarily investigating potential contamination at five Company-owned sites, and has initiated voluntary remediation at four Company-owned sites, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state agencies.
While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the costs related to the previously described investigation and cleanup activities, the Company believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's earnings or competitive position.
EMPLOYEES
The Company employed 49,659 persons as of December 31, 1993.
REGULATION
The development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of the Company's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation, and the general trend is toward more stringent regulation. Government regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, which includes detailed inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, and manufacturing, marketing, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping, storage and disposal practices, substantially increases the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions.
Continuing studies of the utilization, safety, and efficacy of health care products and their components are being conducted by industry, government agencies, and others. Such studies, which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of marketing of such products and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.
The cost of human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in the United States and other countries. In the United States, most states have enacted generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. Federal and state governments continue to press efforts to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid programs, including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for the use of products. Manufacturers must pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates on Medicaid purchases for reimbursement on prescription drugs under state Medicaid plans. In addition, the Federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid. The DRG system entitles a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on discharge diagnoses rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires manufacturers to extend
additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and Public Health Service entities and institutions.
In the United States, governmental cost-containment efforts have extended to the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). All states participate in WIC and have sought and obtained rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. All of the states have also conducted competitive bidding for infant formula contracts which require the use of specific infant formula products for the state WIC program. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 1989 requires all states participating in WIC to engage in competitive bidding upon the expiration of their existing infant formula contracts.
Governmental regulatory agencies now require manufacturers to pay additional fees. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, the Federal Food and Drug Administration imposes substantial fees on various aspects of the approval, manufacture and sale of prescription drugs. Congress is now considering expanding user fees to medical devices. The Company believes that such legislation, if enacted, will add considerable expense for the Company.
In the United States comprehensive legislation has been proposed that would make significant changes to the availability, delivery and payment for healthcare products and services. It is the intent of such proposed legislation to provide health and medical insurance for all United States citizens and to reduce the rate of increases in United States healthcare expenditures. If such legislation is enacted, the Company believes it could have the effect of reducing prices for, or reducing the rate of price increases for health and medical insurance and medical products and services.
International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. Many countries, directly or indirectly through reimbursement limitations, control the selling price of most health care products. Furthermore, many developing countries limit the importation of raw materials and finished products. International regulations are having an impact on United States regulations, as well. The International Organization for Standardization (""ISO"") provides the voluntary criteria for regulating medical devices within the European Economic Community. The Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") has announced that it will attempt to harmonize its regulation of medical devices with that of the ISO. Recently published changes to the FDA's regulations governing the manufacture of medical devices appear to encompass and exceed the ISO's approach to regulating medical devices. The FDA's adoption of the ISO's approach to regulation and other changes to the manner in which the FDA regulates medical devices will increase the cost of compliance with those regulations.
Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector. Health care providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures.
It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Company markets products in approximately 130 countries through affiliates and distributors. Most of the products discussed in the preceding sections of this report are sold outside the United States. In addition, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines to meet local regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and marketed to customers outside the United States. International operations are subject to certain additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action.
ITEM 2.",,,"ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The Company's corporate offices are located at One Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500. The locations of a number of the Company's principal plants are listed below.
In addition to the above, the Company has manufacturing facilities in eight other locations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Overseas manufacturing facilities are located in 19 other countries. The Company's facilities are deemed suitable, provide adequate productive capacity, and are utilized at normal and acceptable levels.
In the United States and Puerto Rico, the Company owns seven distribution centers. The Company also has twelve United States research and development facilities located at Abbott Park, Illinois; Andover, Massachusetts; Ashland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio (2 locations); Irving, Texas; Long Grove, Illinois; Madera, California; Mountain View, California; North Chicago, Illinois; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Santa Clara, California. Overseas, the Company has research and development facilities in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
The corporate offices, all manufacturing plants, and all other facilities in the United States and overseas are owned or leased by the Company or subsidiaries of the Company.
ITEM 3.","ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including (as of January 31, 1994) 7 antitrust suits and 6 investigations in connection with the Company's sale and marketing of infant formula products, 138 product liability cases that allege injuries to the offspring of women who ingested a synthetic estrogen (DES) during pregnancy and 22 antitrust suits in connection with the Company's sale and marketing of pharmaceuticals.
The infant formula antitrust suits, which are pending in various federal and state courts, allege that the Company conspired with one or more of its competitors to fix prices for infant formula, to rig a bid on a contract to provide infant formula under the federal government's Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to deprive states of the benefits of competition in providing rebates to the state pursuant to WIC sales, and to restrain trade and monopolize the market for infant formula products in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits were brought on behalf of individuals, a competitor, the Federal Trade Commission, and state governmental agencies seeking treble damages, civil penalties, and other relief. Three of the 7 cases are pending in state courts in Calhoun County and Shelby County, Alabama and in Austin, Texas. The Calhoun County suit purports to be a class action on behalf of Alabama consumers. The 4 other cases are pending in federal courts in Los Angeles, California, Tallahassee, Florida, Baton Rouge, Louisiana (this suit purports to be a class action on behalf of Louisiana consumers), and Washington, D.C. The Company has filed responses to the complaints denying all substantive allegations. The investigations are being conducted by the Attorneys General of the states of California, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and by the Canadian Bureau of Competition Policy. The four shareholder derivative suits (which were consolidated in federal court in Chicago, Illinois) that had been filed against certain of the Company's officers and directors regarding the Company's sale and marketing of infant formula products were dismissed with prejudice on January 31, 1994.
Twelve of the 22 pharmaceutical antitrust suits are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; 4 are pending in state court in San Francisco County, California; the 6 remaining cases are pending in federal district courts in San Francisco, California, Savannah, Georgia, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Charleston, South Carolina, Austin, Texas, and Galveston, Texas. These suits allege that various pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix drug prices and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies, and HMOs. The suits were brought on behalf of retail pharmacies, seek treble damages and other relief, and some purport to be class actions. The Company intends to respond to the complaints denying all substantive allegations.
While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion, with which its General Counsel concurs, that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

General Business Overview
Power Solutions International, Inc., incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 2011, designs, engineers, manufactures, markets and sells a broad range of advanced, emission-certified engines and power systems that are powered by a wide variety of clean, alternative fuels, including natural gas, propane, and biofuels, as well as gasoline and diesel options, within the energy, industrial and transportation end markets. The Company manages the business as a single segment.
The Company’s products are primarily used by global original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and end-user customers across a wide range of applications and equipment that includes standby and prime power generation, demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, arbor equipment, material handling (including forklifts), agricultural and turf, construction, pumps and irrigation, compressors, utility vehicles, light- and medium-duty vocational trucks, and school and transit buses.
The Company provides highly engineered, comprehensive solutions designed to meet specific customer application requirements and technical specifications, including those imposed by environmental regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) and the People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment (“MEE,” formerly the Ministry of Environmental Protection), as well as regulatory bodies within the European Union (“EU”).
The Company’s products include both sourced and internally designed and manufactured engines that are engineered and integrated with associated components. These comprehensive power systems are tested and validated to meet quality, safety, durability and global environmental standards and regulations.
Through advanced research and development (“R&D”) and engineering capabilities, the Company is able to provide its customers with highly optimized, efficient, durable and emissions-compliant products that enhance their competitive position.
The Company’s business is diversified across end markets and applications and also includes extensive aftermarket and service parts programs. These programs consist of (i) internal aftermarket service parts programs with worldwide sales and distribution capabilities and (ii) internal OEM-developed service parts programs for components and products supplied by the Company.
The Company’s end markets, product categories and equipment are as highlighted in the following table:
Products
The Company’s sourced and internally designed and manufactured engine blocks are engineered and integrated with associated components in a range of configurations that includes basic engine blocks integrated with appropriate fuel system parts as well as completely packaged power systems that include combinations of front accessory drives, cooling systems, electronic systems, air intake systems, fuel systems, housings, power takeoff systems, exhaust systems, hydraulic systems, enclosures, brackets, hoses, tubes, packaging, telematics and other assembled componentry. The Company also designs and manufactures large, custom-engineered integrated electrical power generation systems for both standby and prime power applications. The Company’s comprehensive power systems are tested and validated to meet quality, safety, durability and global environmental standards and regulations.
The Company’s engines and power systems include both emission-certified compression and spark-ignited internal combustion engines ranging from 0.99 liters (“L”) to 53L of displacement, which are enabled by advanced controls to run on a wide variety of clean, alternative fuels, including natural gas, propane, and biofuels, as well as gasoline and diesel options, within the energy, industrial and transportation end markets.
Impact of COVID-19 and Oil and Gas Market Volatility
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and restrictions on the movement of people in the United States and abroad.
During 2020, the global economy experienced substantial turmoil which led to challenging market conditions across certain areas of the Company’s business. Due to unprecedented decreases in demand, an oil price war, and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, average crude oil prices were considerably lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. However, since May 2020 through the date of this 2020 Annual Report, crude oil prices have increased. A significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. While the Company did not experience significant supply chain interruptions or material cancellations of orders during 2020, the Company did see a decline in orders and lower volumes compared to the prior year. In early 2021, the Company experienced delays in its supply chain due to temporary shortages of raw materials and container delays of overseas materials as bottlenecks occurred at ports in Asia and North America. This, in turn, has caused delivery delays to some of the Company’s customers. The Company is also experiencing inflationary cost pressures for certain materials and is working to mitigate the impact through price increases and other measures, where possible. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact on the timing of
delivery of customer orders and the levels of future customer orders. Accordingly, these challenges may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
These factors, in turn, may not only continue to impact the Company’s operations, financial condition and demand for the Company’s goods and services, but its overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of these events. The timing and execution of the strategic initiatives and growth strategies discussed below may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic including the related oil and gas market dynamics.
Strategic Initiatives/Growth Strategies
The Company has initiated a comprehensive set of business objectives aimed at improving profitability, streamlining processes, strengthening the business and focusing on achieving growth in higher-return product lines. Key elements of these objectives and other initiatives are highlighted below.
Improve profitability
The Company has implemented a plan focused on enhancing profitability through the review of its customer and product portfolio. To date, this has resulted in strategic price increases in certain areas of the business, along with product redesign and the re-sourcing of certain components, to support improved margins. This program is a multi-year effort and will entail a strategic assessment of certain areas in which profitability does not meet established thresholds. The Company also continues to transform its manufacturing operations through the ongoing adoption of lean, agile and flexible lines, which provides opportunities for improved efficiency, margins and profitability, particularly as volume and sales improve. It has also been investing heavily in the expansion of its heavy-duty engine product line, which has historically provided better margins. Further, the Company is in the early phases of production of certain products and anticipates potential benefits as it gains improved economies of scale through greater volumes. Lastly, from mid-2016 through mid-2020, the Company incurred substantial costs related to its restatement of prior financial statements. The Company saw a meaningful reduction in professional services fees related to the Company’s efforts to restate prior period financial statements and prepare, audit and file delinquent financial statements with the SEC with the completion of the restatement of its prior financial statements in May 2019 and the filing of all delinquent periodic reports in June 2020. However, the Company continues to incur substantial legal costs related to these matters, including for its obligations to indemnify past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees with respect to the investigations conducted by the SEC and the criminal division of the USAO, which will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources due to the exhaustion of its historical primary directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage. The Company also continues to incur costs related to the remediation of the deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting and for the enhancement of its corporate compliance program pursuant to the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the USAO. Upon the conclusion of these matters, the Company expects to see its expenses decline.
Warranty expense mitigation efforts
The Company aims to curtail its warranty expense through various mitigation efforts. As part of this, the Company is developing reimbursement and commercial remedies from key suppliers, where applicable. Also, the Company is undergoing a continued evaluation and improvement of its engineering validation and reliability programs for products and applications. The Company also continues to make investments in technology to further enhance its tools and processes.
Streamlining of business processes
The Company has an ongoing program to review and identify cost reductions throughout the organization. As part of this program, the Company continues to adopt tighter controls, monitors major areas of spending and is centralizing certain business processes.
Strengthen the business through the optimization of business systems and technology
The Company is working to strengthen its business through the optimization of its business systems and technology to support the remediation of internal controls, improve processes, drive greater operational efficiencies and provide better and timelier decision making across the organization. As part of this initiative, the Company is working on the reimplementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Grow the business in the highest return on investment areas
The Company has been a major participant in the energy market for many years as a supplier to several of the world’s leading power generation companies and through its large custom Generator Set (“Genset”) enclosure business. Building on its broad product offering, in March 2018, October 2018, and October 2019, the Company received EPA certification for its 32L, 40L, and 53L heavy-duty engines, respectively. These heavy-duty engines provide a natural-gas-fueled power range from 500 kilowatt-electric (“kWe”) to 1.25 megawatt (“MW”), which is well above the Company’s prior capabilities, allowing it to serve a greater portion of the demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, and oil and gas markets. Additionally, in
September 2019, the Company received EPA emergency standby certification for its 20L, 40L and 53L diesel engines, which provide a power range of 550 kWe to 1.65 MW. These diesel engines are largely designed for energy market applications including emergency power, wastewater treatment, and oil and gas exploration and production. Also, the engines can handle mission critical customer operations in the health care, data center, hospitality and transportation industries. In addition to dedicating significant R&D resources within the energy market, the Company has also strategically invested in expanding its management, sales and operations staff to support these efforts. The Company’s heavy-duty engines have historically provided better margins.
Capitalize on key market trends
The Company’s breadth of products and solutions will enable it to capitalize on numerous market trends that it believes have the potential to drive customer demand for its products and contribute toward its long-term growth. Further, the Company’s R&D activity is largely focused on expanding its solutions to further address trends in these areas. The key trends include the following:
•the worldwide growth of intermittent sources of energy, such as wind and solar, and an aged electric grid in the United States, coupled with power outage activity due to weather or power shutdowns, which is driving increased demand for generators, microgrids and demand response equipment;
•increasingly stringent regulations and growing efforts to reduce emissions, which are driving demand for clean energy and alternatives to diesel power engines (e.g., EPA Tier 4 emission standards, CARB regulations, MEE policies in China, and grants, rebates and other incentives for adopting clean energy applications), in particular, in several markets such as the power generation market for microgrids and oil and gas applications, school bus and arbor care market, among others;
•growth in datacenters and their increasing demand for electricity, which is driving growth for backup power (commercial generators/microgrids);
•growth in e-commerce activity around the world, which is driving demand for last-mile delivery vehicles; and
•the availability of automotive engines that are suited for industrial application.
New product expansion by leveraging deep industry experience
Throughout the Company’s history, it has evolved from a provider of diesel power systems to become a major supplier of power systems fueled by alternatives to diesel, including gasoline, propane, and natural gas, among others. By leveraging the deep industry experience of its engineering and new-product development teams, the Company is continuing to take steps to broaden the range of its power system product offerings, including engine classes, power ratings and the OEM and direct user market categories into which it supplies products. The Company plans to capitalize on its technologically sophisticated, in-house design, prototyping, testing and application engineering capabilities to further refine its superior power system technology.
Leverage the Company’s relationship with Weichai
In March 2017, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Weichai America Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Weichai Power Co., Ltd. (HK2338, SZ000338) (herein collectively referred to as “Weichai”). Under the terms of the SPA, Weichai invested $60.0 million in the Company (the “Weichai Transactions”) by purchasing a combination of newly issued Common Stock and preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Preferred Stock”), as well as a stock purchase warrant, which significantly strengthened the Company’s financial condition and contributed to the extinguishment of its $60.0 million term loan in 2017. The Company and Weichai also entered into a strategic collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) under which they have been working together to accelerate market opportunities for each company’s respective product lines across various geographic and end-user markets.
The Collaboration Agreement provides the Company with strategic benefits and opportunities, including the ability to leverage Weichai’s strengths and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, procurement and distribution and its widespread sales channels in China and other emerging markets. This collaboration has enabled the Company to broaden its existing product portfolio, improve material quality, decrease costs, accelerate the development of new products and bring them to market, and expand access and exposure to new markets.
Among other things, the Collaboration Agreement establishes a joint steering committee, permits Weichai to second a limited number of certain technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and establishes several collaborations, including with respect to stationary natural gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for the steering committee to create different subcommittees with various operating roles, and it otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of the parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement had a term of three years that was set to expire in March 2020. On March 26, 2020, the Collaboration Agreement was extended for an additional term of three years.
The Weichai stock purchase warrant, as last amended (the “Weichai Warrant”), was exercisable commencing on April 1, 2019 for such number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock as was sufficient to provide Weichai with majority ownership of the Company’s Common Stock. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information-Stock Ownership and Control in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Information, for additional information. Weichai is currently the Company’s majority stockholder, holding over 51% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, as of March 12, 2021.
Expand global business
Through the expansion of its product lineup and the entry into new markets, the Company has a history of growing its product offerings internationally beyond North America. The Company sees long-term opportunity in continuing to grow its business worldwide with further R&D investment including new-product development and offerings.
Strengthened engine development and testing capability
In April 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Chicago Technical Center R&D facility from Ricardo, Inc. This transaction has allowed the Company to significantly strengthen and expand its testing capabilities and increase its capacity to meet current and future engine development, certification and durability testing needs. The advanced R&D facility immediately provided three strategic benefits for the corporate engine programs: (i) increased speed to market response, (ii) greater ability to innovate and optimize product performance and reliability, and (iii) lower cost of product development through direct control of in-house EPA and CARB-certified testing cell operations, scheduling and management of the industry-leading engine testing center.
Sales and Marketing
The Company employs a direct sales and marketing approach to maintain maximum interface with and service support for its OEM customers. This direct interface incorporates the corporate internal technical sales representatives. The Company complements its direct OEM relationships with a localized, independent sales and product support organization. This localized sales and support organization provides the necessary knowledge of local customs and requirements while also delivering immediate sales assistance and customer support.
The Company has invested in and is focused on capturing aftermarket sales of the value-added components that are included in its power systems. With a significant portion of the selling prices of the Company’s power systems coming from value-added components, this is a large, continuing growth opportunity for its aftermarket business.
Customers
The Company’s customers primarily include global OEMs and direct end-users across a wide range of applications that demand high product quality, best-in-class engineering support and on-time delivery. Within several applications for which the Company provides solutions, it maintains supplier relationships with two or more customers, which are often among the largest in that category.
The Company’s largest customers, based upon its consolidated net sales in 2020, included the following subsidiaries/affiliates of Daimler AG: Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Thomas Built Buses and FUSO Company (collectively, “Freightliner”) and Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group. Freightliner and Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group represented 11% and 14% of 2020 consolidated net sales, respectively. The largest customers change from time to time as a result of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, customers’ strategies and inventory of the Company’s power systems.
Competition
In each of the Company’s end markets there are a variety of competitors, including engine manufacturers, independent suppliers and distributors of engines, fuel systems and component providers, manufacturers of power generation equipment, engine packagers and integrators, and the in-house operations of certain OEMs, some of which have longer operating histories, strong brand recognition and significantly greater financial and marketing resources.
Notwithstanding significant competition, the Company believes that the following factors provide it with a differentiated value proposition that allows the Company to compete effectively:
•fuel-agnostic strategy;
•demonstrated expertise in on- and off-road applications;
•ability to leverage Weichai’s strengths and capabilities;
•completeness and comprehensiveness of engines and power systems;
•expansive product integrations, including electronics, controls, fuel systems and transmissions;
•commonality of technology platform spanning all product lines;
•emissions regulation compliance and certification;
•breadth and depth of advanced engineering disciplines;
•industry-leading product and application engineering;
•competitive pricing/cost;
•ability to tailor power systems to specific customer needs;
•performance and quality;
•speed to market; and
•customer support and service.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Darien, Wisconsin, and customizes its power systems to meet specific requirements of OEM applications and the needs of its OEM customers. The Company has invested in precision computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining equipment to finish its internally designed engine blocks and cylinder heads, which are cast by various suppliers. The manufacturing lines in the Company’s production facilities are technologically sophisticated, lean, agile and flexible, and the Company allocates production capacity on its mixed model manufacturing lines to accommodate the demand levels and product mix required by its OEM customers.
The Company focuses on safety, people, quality, on-time delivery, cost and environment in its manufacturing operations. The Company is certified to the most recent International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standard, ISO 9001: 2015. The ISO 9000 family of quality management standards, which must be met in order to become ISO certified, is designed to help organizations monitor and improve the quality and delivery of their products and/or services to their customers. The Company also uses tools such as Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, 80/20, Value Stream Mapping and other manufacturing engineering strategies to help manage its business, build quality, and drive performance and a continuous improvement culture within the manufacturing operations’ teams. The Company also uses a customer relationship management database to help collect customer feedback and to track overall quality performance at its OEM customers. Structured staff training is a constant priority and includes closed-loop quality monitoring and feedback systems.
Research, Development and Engineering
The Company’s research, development and engineering programs are focused on new product development, enhancements to current products, quality improvements and material cost reductions across its product lines. Its efforts are market driven, with the sales team identifying and defining market requirements and trends and its engineering and new-product development groups reviewing existing power system portfolios and developing new solutions that build upon the technology within that portfolio.
The Company’s product and application development engineering teams include in-house mechanical and electrical engineering functions. Internal resources are supplemented with engineering outsourcing relationships for design, development and product testing. In addition to these engineering outsourcing relationships, the Company benefits from the design, development and testing capabilities of its supplier base. The Company staffs its engineering support activities associated with released product and component sourcing programs with dedicated internal engineering personnel.
Research, development and engineering expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, information technology and administrative expenses and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements with its customers to fund a portion of the research, development and engineering costs of a particular project. These reimbursements are accounted for as a reduction of the related research, development and engineering expenditure. The Company’s net research, development and engineering expenditures for 2020 and 2019 were $25.4 million and $24.9 million, respectively.
Supplier Relationships
In addition to producing its own engines, the Company has established relationships with its suppliers for certain engines that are integrated into its comprehensive power systems, the most significant of which are Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. (“Doosan”), a subsidiary of Doosan Group, Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“SAME”), General Motors Company (“GM”) and Weichai. The Company also sources other power system components and coordinates design efforts with third-party suppliers for some of its key components. In general, the prices at which the Company purchases engines, components and other raw materials are based on market factors, including the prices offered by other suppliers operating in the same market and the prevailing market prices of raw materials.
The Company aggregates product sourcing efforts across its large and diverse OEM customer base and across industry categories, capitalizing on volume, economies of scale and global supply opportunities. The Company’s customers benefit from the aggregation of its global sourcing, procurement, and assembly and services, obtaining cost benefits that they might not obtain if they were to rely on their own internal resources, capabilities and more limited demand requirements. Through this process, customers are able to streamline their supply base by consolidating procurement and assembly efforts down to a single part number product supplied by the Company. The Company delivers this assembly to its customer’s production line ready to install into the customers’ product.
The Company is party to a supply agreement with Doosan, under which it purchases and distributes, on an exclusive basis, specified Doosan engines within a territory consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico. On October 1, 2019, the supply agreement with Doosan was amended and extended to December 31, 2023, after which the agreement will automatically be extended for additional one-year terms unless a notice of termination is provided by either party six months prior to the scheduled expiration. The addendum also includes minimum product purchase commitments for the period 2019 through 2023, subject to reductions based on market declines in oil prices and defined prescribed payments to Doosan triggered by shortfalls in purchases made by the Company during each annual calendar period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $0.4 million liability related to a purchasing shortfall of the 2020 volume commitment. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplemental Information for further discussion.
The Company had an exclusive third-party supply agreement with GM through December 31, 2019 to purchase and distribute GM 6.0L engines to on-highway customers. With the GM announcement that it will discontinue its production of the GM 6.0L engine, the Company conducted last-time buys of this engine during 2019 and 2020, and anticipates some additional purchases during 2021, to ensure adequate supply to certain transportation customers. The Company does not have a supply agreement with GM for its successor product to the GM 6.0L engine. However, the Company is actively exploring opportunities to identify engine alternatives for this product.
The Company is also party to a supply agreement with SAME through December 31, 2021 for the exclusive purchase and distribution of engines around the world, with the exception of China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), within the forklift and marine markets. The agreement, which automatically extends for an additional one-year term on an annual basis, unless either party provides notice of termination at least 180 days before the expiration date, includes minimum purchase commitments.
Product Support
The Company’s dedicated team of product and application engineers enables it to deliver high-quality, responsive technical support to its OEM and end-user customers. The Company provides technical support and training to its customers, including in-plant training and support through web- and phone-based field service. The Company further supports its customers by engaging regional providers to perform warranty services and offer support for its power systems. The Company also leverages its technical resources to provide service and support functions for its power systems sold to OEM customers.
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s business.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s workforce consisted of approximately 800 full-time employees. None of the members of the Company’s workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Part of the Company’s values focus on developing and maintaining a world class workforce through personal accountability, teamwork, customer service and innovation. The Company monitors and manages attrition. It approves, through its human resources department, the replacement of key positions that it believes are critical to sustaining improved business performance and analyzes departure data to continually improve upon the experience of employees. Turnover for salaried employees in 2020 was 9.7%. The Company’s talent management and succession planning process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors, and a plan for talent development.
The Company focuses on attracting and retaining the best employees by providing market competitive pay and benefits. This ensures sustainability of the organization. The Company’s short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to provide a variable pay opportunity to reward the attainment of key financial and operational goals as well as shareholder value creation. In addition to the base and variable pay plans, the Company offers employees other benefits including medical, paid-time off, and retirement savings plans.
Health and safety are also a key priority, as the Company is committed to removing conditions that cause personal injury or occupational illness. Employees participate in trainings sessions focused on these topics and are encouraged to promote behaviors that protect others from risk of injury. The Company sets annual targets for its Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) and regularly reviews these metrics. For 2020, the Company achieved an overall TRIR of 2.3, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.28 employees incurred an injury that resulted in recordable medical treatment. The DART was 2.1 in 2020, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.26 individuals experienced an incident that resulted in days away from work.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the Company’s customers and communities, the Company made keeping employees safe a priority. Most of the Company’s employees who can work from home have been doing so since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has allowed the Company to focus resources and investments on its R&D and production facilities including the following steps to help protect the health and safety of employees:
•mandatory temperature screenings at plants and facilities for all employees;
•visitor/vendor questionnaires for all non-employees entering the Company’s facilities;
•mandatory personal protective equipment provided for employees;
•masks required inside open plants and facilities;
•redesigned exits, entrances, and production lines to encourage social distancing; and
•enhanced cleaning protocols before, during, and after shifts.
Impact of Government Regulation
The Company’s power systems are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and noise. The Company’s power systems are subject to compliance with regulatory standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States, including the CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world, such as the MEE. Since its engines are sold into both off-road and on-road markets, the Company must ensure certification to the specific regulations within the applicable statutory segment. For products sold into the U.S. market, both EPA and CARB have imposed specific regulations on engines used in both off-road equipment and on-road vehicles. These regulations generally serve to restrict exhaust emissions, with a primary focus on oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Exhaust emission regulations for engines used in off-highway industrial and power generation equipment vary based upon the use of the equipment into which the engine is incorporated (such as stationary power generation or mobile off-highway industrial equipment) and the type of fuel used to drive the power system. Similarly, on-road regulations from the EPA and CARB focus on the same exhaust constituents as well as sophisticated requirements to meet on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) system regulations. Emissions of GHGs such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen dioxide are also regulated, with more stringent regulatory requirements starting in 2021. The Company continues to make significant investments into the necessary intellectual property that supports full compliance of the Company’s engines now and into the foreseeable future.
The first EPA emissions regulations adopted for diesel engines, known as Tier 1, applied to diesel engines used in mobile off-highway applications in the U.S., and similar standards for diesel engines, known as Stage I regulations, were implemented thereafter in the EU. The EPA and applicable agencies in the EU have continued to develop emissions regulations for diesel engines in the U.S. and the EU, respectively, and have adopted more restrictive standards. The current diesel engine emission requirements in the U.S are known as Tier 4 and are applicable to off-road diesel engines used in industrial equipment. Similarly, the EU has adopted more restrictive standards under its Stage V regulations. Tier 4 and Stage V regulations call for reductions in levels of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.
The Company’s entry into the transportation end market began in 2013 with the development of its 8.8L power systems targeted for 2015 regulatory standards. In 2014, the EPA and CARB certified the Company’s new engine as a Model Year 2015 product for liquid propane gas (“LPG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fuels, and in 2015 the Company launched its first propane-fueled engine for on-road applications. To assist the adoption of alternative-fueled vehicles in the marketplace, the EPA and CARB granted alternative-fueled engines an exemption from OBD regulations until 2018 (CARB)/2019 (EPA). Gasoline engines are not exempt from OBD regulations, therefore, in 2017, the Company achieved full OBD certification for its 2018 and beyond gasoline 6.0L and 8.8L products. The knowledge gained from this gasoline OBD development was applied to the Company’s alternative-fueled engines for 2019 after all OBD exemptions ended as of December 31, 2018. In 2016, the EPA launched new Phase 1 GHG emission regulations. New EPA Phase 2 GHG emission regulations began January 1, 2021.
Historically, the Company’s 6.0L and 8.8L gasoline engines qualified for the small manufacturer exemption for Phase 1 GHG under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation Section 1036.150(d). Starting in 2020, as a result of the Weichai ownership change in April 2019, those products no longer qualified for the exemption and had to meet Phase 1 GHG standards. In order to address the impact of the transition of its emission regulation requirements in 2020 and 2021, the Company licensed its technology to a third-party small manufacturer to produce and certify the 6.0L gasoline engine and utilized averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for the sale of its 8.8L gasoline engine. The Company is also utilizing averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for compliance with the EPA Phase 2 GHG emission regulations.
The initial and ongoing certification requirements vary by power system application and market segment. Each application must undergo a series of rigorous and demanding tests to demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including useful life, zero hours and durability testing. Once a power system is certified, regulatory agencies impose ongoing compliance requirements, which include testing newly produced power systems on a regular quarterly schedule to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, there are field audit requirements, which require the removal of power systems from service at specified stages of their useful lives to perform confirmatory exhaust emissions testing and/or OBD
system audits and testing. All of the Company’s emission-certified power systems meet existing exhaust emission standards of the EPA and CARB. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on the Company’s future financial results.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors.
The Company’s business and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those listed below, many of which are not within the Company’s control, which may cause actual financial performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. New risks may emerge at any time, and the Company cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect its results of operations.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and future periods may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other outbreaks of infectious disease or similar public health threats and the resulting economic impact.
Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and restrictions on the movement of people in the United States and abroad. As discussed in Item 1. Business, these factors have impacted and will continue to impact the Company’s operations, financial condition and demand for the Company’s goods and services. Depending on the severity and longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s business, employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders may continue to experience significant negative impacts for future periods. In addition, due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to develop and evolve, there is significant uncertainty around its ultimate impact on public health, business operations and the overall economy; therefore, the negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact may continue to be material in the future.
In April 2020, the Company implemented contingency actions as a result of the expected significant negative impacts of these factors. The Company’s temporary cost reduction measures included:
•reduced hours of operations of the Company’s production facilities;
•reduced work week for all office employees;
•reduced pay for salaried employees between 10% and 30%, depending on the employee’s position;
•suspended the Company’s 401(k) plan match;
•deferred spending on certain R&D programs;
•implemented a hiring freeze;
•restricted all non-essential travel; and
•minimized discretionary expenses and consulting services.
The measures with regard to pay for salaried employees and the suspension of the Company’s 401 (k) plan match were in effect through December 31, 2020. Any additional cost savings initiatives or other cash actions the Company undertakes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not achieve the intended results and may result in other adverse impacts, which could be material.
The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depends upon future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration, location, and spread of the outbreak, its severity, government and business measures to contain the virus and address its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We cannot, at this time, predict the many potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.
Liquidity and Indebtedness
The Company’s management has concluded as of the filing of this 2020 Annual Report that, due to uncertainty surrounding the Company’s ability to extend or refinance its current debt agreements and uncertainty as to whether it will have sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful, and it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had debt outstanding under its credit agreement between the Company and Standard Chartered Bank (“Standard Chartered”) (the “ Credit Agreement”) of $130.0 million. In March 2021, the Company amended and restated the Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement matures on March 25, 2022, is uncommitted, and is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement includes certain financial covenants as well as a change of control provision. In addition, Standard Chartered has the right to demand payment of any and all outstanding borrowings and other amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement at any point in time at its discretion. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the shareholder’s loan agreement originally executed with Weichai in December 2020 (the “First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement”). The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement provides the Company with access to $130.0 million of credit solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement. The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022. Due to the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement’s current maturity date, the Company will need to extend and amend or refinance the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement on or before March 25, 2022.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on generating profitable operating results, having sufficient liquidity, maintaining compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement and extending and amending, refinancing or repaying the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement.
There can be no assurance that it will be able to complete a financing on acceptable terms or repay this outstanding indebtedness, when required or if at all. If the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
Furthermore, if the Company cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, it may not, among other things, be able to do the following:
•continue to expand the Company’s research and product investments and sales and marketing organization;
•expand operations both organically and through acquisitions; and
•respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness and is highly leveraged. Its existing debt or any potential new debt could adversely affect its business and growth prospects.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s total debt obligations, including indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, was $131.1 million. The Company’s debt arrangements contain and may contain in the future certain requirements, including specific financial and other covenants or restrictions. The failure or the inability to meet such obligations under existing debt or any new debt could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. In addition, the Company’s debt obligations could make it more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates. The Company’s indebtedness and the cash flow needed to satisfy its debt obligations and the covenants contained in current and potential future debt agreements could have important consequences, including the following:
•limiting funds available for borrowing through the imposition of availability blocks;
•limiting funds otherwise available for financing capital expenditures by requiring dedication of a portion of cash flows from operating activities to the repayment of debt and the interest on such debt;
•limiting the ability to incur additional indebtedness;
•limiting the ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, including mergers, acquisitions and other strategic transactions;
•making the Company more vulnerable to rising interest rates or higher interest rates; and
•making the Company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business.
The Company’s Amended and Restated Uncommited Revolving Credit Agreement places limitations on its ability to make acquisitions and restricts its ability to incur additional indebtedness. Any future failure by the Company to comply with the financial covenants set forth under the Amended and Restated Uncommited Revolving Credit Agreement, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of debt maturities or prevent the Company from accessing availability under the Amended and Restated Uncommited Revolving Credit Agreement. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated, the Company may not have sufficient cash resources, or have the ability to obtain financing through alternative resources, to satisfy its debt and other obligations, and the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.
Litigation and Internal Control Remediation
The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that have not been fully remediated. If its remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if the Company otherwise fails to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report financial results, timely file periodic reports, maintain its reporting status or prevent fraud.
In connection with the Company’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, the Company concluded that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, included in Part II, for additional information regarding these matters.
The Company’s management may identify other material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses could harm its business, the market price of its Common Stock and its ability to retain the Company’s current, or obtain new, lenders, suppliers, key employees, alliance and strategic partners or require the implementation of certain undertakings with the SEC. In addition, the existence of material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting may affect its ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. The inability to timely file periodic reports could result in the SEC revoking the registration of the Company’s Common Stock, which would negatively impact the Company’s ability to re-list its Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market or any other stock exchange.
The Company has incurred significant costs in connection with the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements and its failure to timely file prior periodic reports and will continue to incur significant costs to remediate material weaknesses in internal control.
The Company has incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, and lender and noteholder consent fees, related to the restatement of its previously issued consolidated financial statements and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur certain of these expenses in the future. The Company has taken a number of actions, including adding significant internal resources and implementing a number of additional procedures and controls, in order to strengthen its accounting function and reduce the risk of future material misstatements in its financial statements. In addition, in September 2020, the Company settled the investigations by the SEC and USAO into the Company’s past revenue recognition practices. As part of the settlement, among other undertakings, the Company committed to remediate the deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses as identified in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures by April 30, 2021 unless an extension is provided by the SEC. To the extent that the Company’s actions are not successful and completed in accordance with the provisions of the settlement with the SEC and USAO, the Company may be forced to incur additional time and expense towards further remediation efforts and incremental substantive procedures, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the provisions of the settlement agreements with the SEC and USAO could result in further actions by one or both governmental agencies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Limitations of the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance and potential indemnification obligations will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Under its bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, the Company has obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors and certain current and former employees. Based on cumulative legal fees and settlements incurred, the Company fully exhausted its primary directors and officers insurance coverage of $30.0 million during the first quarter of 2020. Additional expenses currently expected to be incurred and that may occur in the future and/or liabilities that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company’s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Since
exhausting its primary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage in early 2020, the Company has incurred over $7 million related to its indemnification obligation. Such expenses could continue to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Financial Condition, Results of Operations, and Cash Flows
The Company has experienced substantial net losses in recent fiscal years and may continue to experience net losses.
The Company generated a net loss in fiscal year 2020 compared to net income in fiscal year 2019 and has an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020. The net loss experienced in 2020 was principally attributable to low sales volume largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related historic decline in oil demand, significant warranty expense primarily related to certain engines sold into the transportation end market, legal and professional expenses associated with efforts to file the Company’s prior financial statements, remediate material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, respond to the government investigations and defend the lawsuits related to the restatements as well as indemnifications of certain current and former directors and officers of the Company, high outstanding debt, and borrowing costs. The Company expects that many of these costs will remain significant in future periods. Continued losses could reduce cash available from operations to service or refinance the Company’s indebtedness as necessary, as well as limit the Company’s ability to finance future growth in its business and implement its strategies.
The Company could incur restructuring and impairment charges as it evaluates its portfolio of assets and identifies opportunities to restructure its business to optimize its cost structure.
The Company continuously evaluates its portfolio of assets and its operational structure in an effort to identify opportunities to optimize its cost structure including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to asset impairments and employee termination costs, any of which could be significant and could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.
The Company has substantial amounts of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, requires significant judgment. Declines in profitability due to changes in volume, market pricing, cost or the business environment could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
The Company is subject to price increases in some of the key components in its power systems.
The prices of some of the key components of the Company’s power systems are subject to fluctuation due to market forces, including changes in the costs of raw materials incorporated into these components. Such price increases occur from time to time due to spot shortages of commodities, increases in labor costs or longer-term shortages due to market forces. In particular, the prices of certain precious metals, such as palladium and rhodium, used in emissions-control systems fluctuate frequently and often significantly. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials used in components that the Company sources from suppliers may result in increased prices charged by suppliers. If the Company incurs price increases from suppliers for key components in its power systems, production costs will increase, and given competitive market conditions, the Company may not be able to pass all or any of those cost increases on to OEM customers in the form of higher sales prices. To the extent that its competitors do not suffer comparable component cost increases, the Company may have even greater difficulty passing along price increases, and the Company’s competitive position may be harmed. As a result, increases in costs of key components may adversely affect the Company’s margins and otherwise adversely affect its results of operations.
Many of the Company’s power systems involve long and variable design and sales cycles.
The design and sales cycle for customized power systems, from initial contact with potential OEM customers to the commencement of shipments, may be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of solutions before making a decision to purchase power systems. Before an OEM commits to purchase power systems, they often require a significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time the Company’s customers are evaluating its products, the Company may incur substantial sales and marketing, engineering, and research and development expenses to customize the power systems to the customer’s needs.
Warranty, Safety Standards, and Emissions
The Company could suffer warranty claims or be subject to product liability claims, both of which could materially adversely affect its business.
The Company’s power systems are sophisticated and complex, and the success of the power systems is dependent, in part, upon the quality and performance of key components, such as engines, fuel systems, generators, breakers, and complex electrical components and associated software. The Company may incur liabilities for warranty claims as a result of defective products or
components, including claims arising from defective products or components provided by its suppliers that are integrated into its power systems.
The provisions the Company makes for warranty accrual may not be sufficient, or it may be unable to rely on a warranty provided by a third-party manufacturer or recover costs incurred associated with defective components or products provided by its suppliers. The Company may recognize additional expenses as a result of warranty claims in excess of its current expectations. Such warranty claims may necessitate a redesign, re-specification, a change in manufacturing processes and/or a recall of its power systems, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and on existing or future sales of its power systems and other products. Even in the absence of any warranty claims, a product deficiency such as a manufacturing defect or a safety issue may necessitate a product recall, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and on existing or future sales.
The Company is exposed to potential product liability claims that are inherent to natural gas, propane, gasoline and diesel and products that use these fuels. Natural gas, propane, diesel and gasoline are flammable and are potentially dangerous products. Any accidents involving the Company’s power systems could materially impede widespread market acceptance and demand for its power systems. In addition, the Company may be subject to a claim by end-users of its OEM customers’ products or others alleging that they have suffered property damage, personal injury or death because its power systems or the products of its customers into which its power systems are integrated did not perform adequately. Such a claim could be made whether or not the Company’s power systems perform adequately under the circumstances. From time to time, the Company may be subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business, and it carries a limited amount of product liability insurance for this purpose. However, current insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage for such claims, and the Company cannot predict whether it will be able to maintain insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms.
The Company and its products are subject to numerous environmental and regulatory policies, including emission and fuel economy rules.
The Company’s business is affected by government environmental policies, mandates and regulations around the world, most significantly with respect to emission standards in the United States. Examples of such regulations include those that (i) restrict the sale of power systems that do not meet emission standards and (ii) impose penalties on sellers of noncompliant power systems.
The Company generally must obtain product certification from both the EPA and the CARB to sell its products in the United States. The Company may attempt to expand sales of its certified power systems to OEMs that sell their products in other countries, which may also have stringent emissions requirements. Accordingly, future sales of the Company’s products will depend upon its products being certified to meet the existing and future air quality and energy standards imposed by the relevant regulatory agencies. While the Company incurs significant research and development costs to ensure that its products comply with emission standards and meet certification requirements in the regions in which its products are sold, the Company cannot provide assurance that its products will continue to meet those standards. The failure to comply with certification requirements would not only adversely affect future sales but could result in the recall of products or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The adoption of new, more stringent and burdensome government emissions regulations, whether at the foreign, federal, state or local level, in markets in which the Company supplies power systems may require modification of emission certification and other manufacturing processes for its power systems. The Company might incur additional and/or unanticipated expenses in meeting future compliance requirements, and it may be required to increase its research and product development expenditures. Increases in such costs and expenses could necessitate increases in the prices the Company charges for its power systems, which could adversely affect demand for such power systems. There are no assurances that the Company will have adequate financial or technical resources in the future to maintain compliance with government emissions standards.
Historically, the Company’s 6.0L and 8.8L gasoline engines qualified for the small manufacturer exemption for Phase 1 GHG under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation Section 1036.150(d). Starting in 2020, as a result of the Weichai ownership change in April 2019, those products no longer qualified for the exemption and must meet Phase 1 GHG standards. In order to address the impact of the transition of its emission regulation requirements in 2020 and 2021, the Company licensed its technology to a third-party small manufacturer to produce and certify the 6.0L gasoline engine and utilized averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for the sale of its 8.8L gasoline engine. New EPA Phase 2 GHG regulations began January 1, 2021. The Company plans to meet Phase 2 GHG standards utilizing averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions. Future changes to the regulations and/or failure of the Company to comply with the regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Supply Chain
The Company is dependent on third-party suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these key suppliers, or the failure to find replacement suppliers or manufacturers in a timely manner, could result in supply shortages.
The Company sources engines, components and replacement parts used in the assembly of its power systems and aftermarket sales from various third-party suppliers. Much of the technology incorporated into the components that the Company sources from a limited number of suppliers is technologically sophisticated, and the Company does not believe that its competitors have access to some of this sophisticated technology. The Company’s business could be harmed by adverse changes in its relationships with these suppliers, including through the management of the timing of payables, or if its competitors gain access to such technology. The viability of certain key third-party suppliers, or the exiting by certain suppliers of certain business lines, could require the Company to find other suppliers for materials or components. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers that are part of the Company’s supply chain. In early 2021, the Company experienced delays in its supply chain due to temporary shortages of raw materials and container delays of overseas materials as bottlenecks occurred at ports in Asia and North America. This, in turn, has caused delivery delays to some of the Company’s customers. If future work stoppages were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be additional supply shortages, which could continue to impact the Company’s ability to deliver its products to customers on schedule. Some components cannot be quickly or inexpensively re-sourced to another supplier due to long lead times and contractual commitments that might be required by another supplier in order to provide the components or materials. Any extended delay in receiving engines or other critical components, or the inability of third-party suppliers to meet the Company’s quality, quantity or cost requirements, could impair or prohibit the Company’s ability to deliver products to its OEM customers.
The loss of certain of the Company’s exclusive supply and distribution agreements, coupled with the Company’s inability to manufacture or source alternative products, could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
The Company is the exclusive supplier and distributor of certain engine products sourced from certain engine manufacturers. The agreements provide the Company with the exclusive rights to distribute the associated products in certain geographic regions. The Company may not be able to extend the agreements or may not achieve acceptable pricing. For example, the Company was an exclusive supplier of the GM 6.0L engine to OEMs and GM is discontinuing the engine. The Company does not have an agreement with GM to supply on-highway OEMs with GM’s successor product to the 6.0L engine. If the Company is not able to maintain the arrangements or achieve competitive pricing, then it may need to find alternative products through either alternative supply sources or the design and manufacture of competitive products to meet customer demands. The loss of any of the exclusive supply agreements and failure to source alternative products could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. In addition, the exclusive agreements often include minimum purchase requirements. The failure to reach the minimum purchase requirements could result in financial penalties or the loss of exclusivity that could be material to the Company.
The Company utilizes a global supply chain to source products, including engines, components and materials, which may subject it to tariffs, including U.S. tariffs imposed on imports from China. The Company also sells its products on a global basis, and therefore its export sales could be impacted by tariffs.
Several of the Company’s products are sourced internationally, including from China, where the United States has imposed tariffs on specified products imported from China. These tariffs have an impact on the Company’s material costs and have the potential to have an even greater impact, depending on the outcome of future trade negotiations and policies. The Company is evaluating U.S. government policy, which is subject to change in the current negotiating environment, pricing, its supply chain and its operational strategies to mitigate the impact of these tariffs; however, there can be no assurances that any mitigation strategies employed will remain available under government policy or that the Company will be able to offset tariff-related costs or maintain competitive pricing of its products. Further, the imposition of tariffs on imports from China and other countries has the potential to materially and adversely impact the Company’s sales, profitability and future product launches. The Company also sells its products on a global basis; and, therefore, its export sales could be impacted by the tariffs. Any material reduction in sales may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Growth and Profitability
The market for alternative-fueled, spark-ignited power systems may not continue to develop as expected.
The continued growth of the market for efficient alternative-fueled, spark-ignited power systems, including natural gas, propane and gasoline, is a key tenet of the Company’s growth strategy. The impact of diesel emission regulations is expected to increase the cost and complexity of diesel power systems, but this may not materialize to the expected extent or at all. Also, customers, or potential customers, may not substitute natural gas-, propane- and gasoline-powered power systems for diesel power systems in response to these regulations. In addition, to the extent that diesel power system manufacturers develop the ability to design and produce emission-compliant diesel power systems that are more competitive than the Company’s alternative-fueled power systems, customers and potential customers may be less likely to substitute alternative-fueled power systems for diesel power
systems. Furthermore, if alternative-fueled power systems are substituted for diesel power systems, there can be no assurance that the Company’s power systems would capture any portion of the potential market increase. If the industrial OEM market generally, or more specifically any of the OEM categories that represent a significant portion of the Company’s business or in which it anticipates significant growth opportunities for its power systems, fails to develop or develops more slowly than the Company anticipates, its business could be materially adversely affected.
The Company may be impacted by volatility of oil and gas prices and/or fuel price differentials.
The prices of various fuel alternatives are subject to fluctuation, based upon many factors, including global supply and demand, changes in resource base, pipeline transportation capacity for natural gas, refining capacity for crude oil, and government excise and fuel tax policies. The price differential among various fuel alternatives can impact OEMs and their decisions on which, if any, power systems they purchase from the Company. Furthermore, if OEMs do decide to purchase the Company’s power systems, relative fuel prices may affect which power systems they purchase, and the margins can vary significantly among the Company’s various power systems.
The Company may be affected by the price of oil and gas. For example, when the price of oil declines, oil becomes a more favorable source of fuel in the short term, and alternative fuel and energy producers suffer as a result. This volatility, as with any commodity, will occur from time to time and may adversely affect the Company’s business.
Also, a significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from sales of products that are used in the oil and gas industry, primarily in support of operating wells. At times of severely depressed oil prices, as was experienced in the market during 2020, oil and gas producers have curtailed capital expenditures, sometimes sharply. In addition, oil and gas producers may cease or suspend production at well sites that have or are likely to become unprofitable. As a result, sales of the Company’s products could be severely impacted during periods of a prolonged depression in energy prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. The Company estimates that as much as approximately $45.0 million and $105.0 million of its 2020 and 2019 net sales, respectively, were attributable to the sale of products used within the oil and gas industry. The potential impact of future disruptions, continued economic uncertainty, and continued depressed crude oil prices and low rig count levels may have a significant adverse impact that may result in the recognition of material impairments or other related charges.
The introduction of new products, including new engines that the Company develops, and the continued expansion of products in the energy and transportation markets may not succeed or achieve widespread acceptance.
The Company’s growth depends on its ability to develop and/or acquire new products and/or refine existing products and power system technology, to complement and enhance the breadth of its power system offerings with respect to engine class and the OEM market categories into which the Company supplies its products. The Company will generally seek to develop or acquire new products, or enhance existing products and power system technology, if it believes such acquisitions or enhancements will provide significant additional sales and favorable profit margins. However, the Company cannot know beforehand whether any new or enhanced products will successfully penetrate target markets. There can be no assurance that newly developed or acquired products will perform as well as the Company expects, or that such products will gain widespread adoption among the Company’s customers.
Additionally, there are greater design and operational risks associated with new products. The inability of the Company’s suppliers to produce technologically sophisticated components for new engines and power systems, the discovery of any product or process defects or failures associated with production of any new products, and any related product returns could each have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and its results of operations. If new products that the Company expends significant resources to develop or acquire are not successful, or such products do not achieve the required production volume and scale, its business could be adversely affected.
The Company’s strategy includes production of in-house developed and manufactured engines used by OEM customers, including large transportation OEMs. The costs and regulations involved with developing and certifying an engine for transportation applications are significant and may be higher and more stringent than expected. Additionally, the stresses and demands on engines and power systems used for transportation applications could result in unexpected issues. The discovery of any significant problems with these engines could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, potential product liability claims, and reputational and brand risks. Sales of the Company’s internally developed engines could lead to significantly higher warranty costs to service these engines if they do not perform to expectations.
The Company’s OEM customers may not continue to outsource their power system needs.
The purchasers of the Company’s power systems are OEMs that manufacture a wide range of applications and equipment that include standby and prime power generation, demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, utility power, arbor equipment, material handling (including forklifts), agricultural and turf, construction, pumps and irrigation, compressors, utility vehicles, light- and medium-duty vocational trucks, and school and transit buses. As a result of the significant resources and expertise required to develop and manufacture emission-certified power systems, certain of these customers have historically
chosen to outsource production of power systems to the Company. To a significant extent, the Company depends on OEMs continuing to outsource design and production of power systems, power system components and subsystems. OEM customers may not continue to outsource as much or any of their power system production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in the Company’s customers’ business strategies, acquisition by a customer of a power system manufacturer or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any number of these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business.
The Company currently faces, and will continue to face, significant competition.
The market for the Company’s products and related services is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to new-product and service introductions and changes in technical requirements. New developments in power system technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of the Company’s power systems or make them uncompetitive or obsolete. Other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial and marketing resources than the Company, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, certain of the Company’s products and power system technologies. If the markets for its products grow as the Company anticipates, competition may intensify, as existing and new competitors identify opportunities in such markets.
The Company faces competition from companies that employ current power system technologies, and it may face competition in the future from additional companies as new power system technologies are adopted. Additionally, the Company may face competition from companies developing technologies such as cleaner diesel engines, biodiesel, fuel cells, advanced batteries and hybrid battery/internal combustion power systems. The Company may not be able to incorporate such technologies into its product offerings, or it may be required to devote substantial resources to do so. The success of its business depends in large part on its ability to provide single assembly, integrated, comprehensive, technologically sophisticated power systems to its customers. The development or enhancement by its competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect the Company’s business.
Technology and Intellectual Property
Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect the Company’s operations.
The Company is engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The Company’s success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. The Company may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes, and product or process enhancements. The Company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. The Company’s products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If the Company were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes, or product or process enhancements, or if its products do not gain market acceptance, its results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
The Company could fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or could face claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties.
The Company believes that the success of its business depends, in substantial part, upon its proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. The Company does not own any material patents and relies on a combination of trademark and trade secret laws, along with confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. Despite the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights, existing laws afford only limited protection, and the Company’s actions may be inadequate to protect its rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the Company’s proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. The unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property rights and proprietary technology by others could materially harm its business.
In addition, the Company cannot be certain that its products, services and power system technologies, including any intellectual property licensed from third parties for use therein or incorporated into components that it sources from its suppliers, do not, or in the future will not, infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the future, the Company may be subject to infringement claims that may result in litigation. Successful infringement claims against the Company could result in substantial monetary liability, require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or otherwise materially disrupt the conduct of the Company’s business. In addition, even if the Company prevails in the defense of any such claims, any such litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to defend or settle and could materially adversely affect its business.
Human Capital
The loss of key members of management or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could, in the future, affect the Company’s business results.
The Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. In the last six months, the Company has experienced significant leadership changes, including appointing a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. Executive leadership transitions can be difficult to manage and could cause disruption to the Company’s business. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of management and personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute its operational strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder the Company’s ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products. As the Company continues to expand, it will need to promote or hire additional staff, and, as a result of increased compensation and benefit mandates, it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals without incurring significant additional costs.
Common Stock Ownership and Stockholder Influence
Ownership of the Company’s stock is concentrated among certain current and former employees and Weichai, therefore limiting other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.
As of March 12, 2021, Weichai beneficially owned 51.3% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock. Additionally, Gary S. Winemaster, the Company’s founder, former Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President and nonexecutive Chief Strategy Officer, beneficially owned approximately 14.5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock, and Kenneth J. Winemaster, the Company’s co-founder and Executive Vice President, beneficially owned approximately 9.7% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock. Each of these stockholders, by virtue of their significant equity ownership in the Company, may be able to significantly influence, and, in the case of Weichai, control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. With the exercise of the Weichai Warrant, Weichai alone owns a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and, therefore, it possesses voting control over the Company sufficient to prevent any change of control from occurring.
Weichai also maintains certain rights through its Investor Rights Agreement with the Company.
Weichai entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) with the Company upon execution of the SPA. The Rights Agreement provides Weichai with representation on the Company’s Board and management representation rights. Weichai currently has four representatives on the Board which constitutes the majority of the directors serving on the Board. According to the Rights Agreement, during any period when the Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Listing Rules, it will take such measures as to avail itself of the “controlled company” exemptions available under Rule 5615 of the NASDAQ Listing Rules of Rules 5605(b), (d) and (e). With Weichai being the majority owner of the Company’s outstanding shares of its Common Stock, Weichai will be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholders’ approval, including the election of the Directors, amendment of the Company’s Charter and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions impractical without the support of Weichai.
The continued delisting of its Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The historical failure to timely file its periodic reports with the SEC resulted in the Company not being in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC, and triggered the delisting of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company’s delisting and potential inability to remediate failures to comply with applicable NASDAQ rules to be relisted could have a material adverse effect on the Company by, among other things, reducing:
•the liquidity of its Common Stock;
•the market price of its Common Stock;
•the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in its Common Stock;
•the number of market makers in its Common Stock;
•the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of its Common Stock;
•the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of its Common Stock;
•the Company’s ability to obtain equity financing for the continuation of its operations;
•the Company’s ability to use its equity as consideration in any merger transaction; and
•the effectiveness of equity-based compensation plans for its employees used to attract and retain individuals important to the Company’s operations.
NOLs and Future Tax Payments
The Company’s inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future may limit the Company’s ability to use net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards to reduce future tax payments.
The Company has NOL carryforwards with which to offset its future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes. If the Company should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforward periods, then it will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. Similar limitations also apply to certain U.S. federal tax credits.
General Risk Factors
The Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.
The Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities. The Company’s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems, result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information, compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees, and jeopardize the security of the Company’s facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage its reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on its reputation and results of operations.
The Company is exposed to political, economic and other risks, in addition to various laws and regulations that arise from operating a multinational business.
The Company sells products internationally and sources a significant amount of materials from suppliers outside of the U.S. Accordingly, the Company is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating a multinational company, including risks related to the following:
•general economic conditions;
•the imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers, which could potentially disrupt the Company’s existing supply chains and impose additional costs on the Company’s business;
•trade and technology protection measures;
•compliance with regulations governing import and export activities;
•import and export duties and restrictions;
•currency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;
•transportation delays and interruptions;
•potentially adverse income tax consequences;
•political and economic instability;
•terrorist activities;
•labor unrest;
•natural disasters; and
•public health concerns including the potential negative impacts to suppliers, customers or the Company’s business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company’s business in 2020 and will likely have future impacts in 2021 and beyond. Furthermore, the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions and work restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on the Company’s customer base, suppliers, and general commercial activity.
Also, the Company is subject to, and may become subject to, various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing its business, environmental, labor, trade and tax practices. These laws and regulations, particularly those applicable to the Company’s international operations, are or may be complex, extensive and subject to change. The Company needs to ensure that it and its OEM customers and suppliers timely comply with such laws and regulations, which may result in increased operating costs. Other legislation has been, and may in the future be, enacted in other locations in which the Company manufactures or sells its products. If the Company or its component suppliers fail to timely comply with applicable legislation, its customers may refuse to purchase its products, or it may face increased operating costs as a result of taxes, fines or penalties. In connection with complying with such environmental laws and regulations as well as with industry environmental initiatives, the standards of business conduct required by some of its customers and its commitment to sound corporate citizenship in all aspects of its business, the Company could incur substantial compliance and operating costs and be subject to disruptions to its operations and logistics. In addition, if the Company were found to be in violation of these laws or noncompliant with these initiatives or standards of conduct, it could be subject to governmental fines, liability to its customers and damage to its reputation and corporate brand, any of which could cause its financial condition or results of operations to suffer.
Lastly, the Company’s overseas sales are subject to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws and regulations, which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards that the Company implements to discourage these practices could prove to be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and other laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against the Company, including class action lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC, the USAO and overseas regulators. Any of these factors, or any other international factors, could impair the Company’s ability to effectively sell its power systems, or other products or services that it may develop, outside of the United States.

The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements about the Company’s business and consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including discussions about management’s expectations for the Company’s business. These statements represent projections, beliefs and expectations based on current circumstances and conditions and in light of recent events and trends, and these statements should not be construed either as assurances of performance or as promises of a given course of action. Instead, various known and unknown factors are likely to cause the Company’s actual performance and management’s actions to vary, and the results of these variances may be both material and adverse. A description of material factors known to the Company that may cause its results to vary, or may cause management to deviate from its current plans and expectations, is set forth under “Risk Factors” in this report. See also
“Forward-Looking Statements.” The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the related Notes included in this report.
Executive Overview
The Company designs, engineers, manufactures, markets and sells a broad range of advanced, emission-certified engines and power systems that run on a wide variety of clean, alternative fuels, including natural gas, propane, and biofuels, as well as gasoline and diesel options, within the energy, industrial and transportation end markets with primary manufacturing, assembly, engineering, R&D, sales and distribution facilities located in suburban Chicago, Illinois and Darien, Wisconsin. The Company provides highly engineered, comprehensive solutions designed to meet specific customer application requirements and technical specifications, including those imposed by environmental regulatory bodies, such as the EPA, the CARB and the MEE.
The Company’s products are primarily used by global OEM and end-user customers across a wide range of applications and equipment that includes standby and prime power generation, demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, arbor care, material handling (including forklifts), agricultural and turf, construction, pumps and irrigation, compressors, utility vehicles, light- and medium-duty vocational trucks, school and transit buses, and utility power. The Company manages the business as a single reporting segment.
For 2020, net sales decreased $128.4 million, or 24%, compared to 2019, as a result of sales decreases of $73.5 million, $49.1 million, and $5.9 million in the energy, industrial, and transportation end markets, respectively. Gross margin was 14.0% and 18.3% during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross profit decreased during 2020 by $41.4 million compared to 2019, while operating expenses decreased by $2.5 million as compared to 2019. Interest expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2020 versus 2019. The Company recognized a loss of $1.4 million in 2019 as a result of the change in the value of the Weichai Warrant including the impact of the exercise in the second quarter of 2019. See Note 3. Weichai Transactions, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. There was no impact from a change in the value of warrants for 2020 due to the Weichai Warrant being exercised in April 2019. Also, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million for 2020 versus an expense of $0.4 million for 2019. Collectively, these factors contributed to a $31.2 million increase in the net loss, which totaled $23.0 million in 2020 compared to net income of $8.2 million in 2019. Diluted loss per share was $1.00 in the 2020 period compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 in 2019. Adjusted net loss, which excludes certain items described below that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operating performance, was $11.1 million in 2020 compared to Adjusted net income of $28.1 million in 2019. Adjusted loss per share was $0.48 in 2020 compared to Adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 in 2019. Adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was $3.0 million in 2020 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $45.2 million in 2019. Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted (loss) earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of each of these measures to the nearest applicable GAAP financial measure, as well as additional information about these non-GAAP measures, see the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Item 7.
Net sales by geographic area and by end market for 2020 and 2019 are presented below:
During 2020, the Company sold over 44,000 engines of which approximately 63% utilized propane or natural gas as their fuel source and 31% utilized gasoline. The remaining 6% of engines were dual fuel gasoline/propane, diesel and service/base engines.
Weichai Transactions
In March 2017, the Company and Weichai entered into a number of transactions (see Note 3. Weichai Transactions, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information), including the issuance of Common and Preferred Stock and a stock purchase warrant to Weichai for aggregate proceeds of $60.0 million. The stock purchase warrant issued to Weichai was exercisable for any number of additional shares of Common Stock such that Weichai, upon exercise, would hold 51% of the Common Stock then outstanding on a fully dilutive basis, on terms and subject to adjustments as provided in the SPA. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant and increased its ownership to 51.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, as of such date.
Through the Weichai Transactions, the Company sought to expand its range of products and its presence in the Pacific Rim.
The Company and Weichai executed the Collaboration Agreement in order to achieve their respective objectives, enhance the cooperation alliance and share experiences, expertise and resources. Among other things, the Collaboration Arrangement established a joint steering committee, permitted Weichai to second a limited number of technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and established several collaborations related to stationary natural-gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for the steering committee to create various subcommittees with operating roles and otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement had a term of three years that was set to expire in March 2020. On March 26, 2020, the Collaboration Agreement was extended for an additional term of three years. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales to Weichai were not material. The Company purchased $18.6 million and $4.4 million of inventory from Weichai during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Incremental Financial Reporting, Internal Control Remediation, and Government Investigation and Other Legal Matter Expenses
Incremental financial reporting, internal control remediation and government investigation and other legal matter expenses consist of professional services fees related to the Company’s efforts to restate prior period financial statements, prepare, audit and file delinquent financial statements, and remediate internal control material weaknesses as well as fees and reserves related to Company, SEC, and USAO investigations. Since August 2016, the Company has experienced a substantial and disruptive diversion of management resources to address various accounting, financial reporting and financial issues. During that time, the Company determined that it was necessary to restate financial results for 2014 and 2015 as well as the first quarter of 2016 and, since then, has also focused on becoming timely on all of its SEC financial reporting requirements, which was achieved with the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the SEC and the USAO conducted investigations into the Company’s financial reporting, revenue recognition practices and related conduct. These investigations were completed and settled in September 2020 (see Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies, included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information). Incremental financial reporting, internal control remediation, and government investigation and other legal matter expenses, included in the 2020 and 2019 operating results, were $15.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively.
Recent Trends and Business Outlook
Recent COVID-19 Outbreak, Oil and Gas Market Volatility, and 2021 Outlook
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns, and restrictions on the movement of people in the United States and abroad. These factors, in turn, have impacted and may continue to impact the Company’s operations, financial condition, and demand for its goods and services, as well as its overall ability to react timely to mitigate any further impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the Company aggressively implemented contingency actions as a result of the expected significant negative impacts of these factors. The Company’s temporary cost reduction measures included:
•reduced hours of operations of the Company’s production facilities;
•reduced work week for all office employees;
•reduced pay for salaried employees between 10% and 30%, depending on the employee’s position;
•suspended the Company’s 401(k) plan match;
•deferred spending on certain R&D programs;
•implemented a hiring freeze;
•restricted all non-essential travel; and
•minimized discretionary expenses and consulting services.
The measures with regard to pay for salaried employees and the suspension of the Company’s 401 (k) match plan match were in effect through December 31, 2020. As of the date of this 2020 Annual Report, the Company continues to judiciously manage its expenses through the continuation of certain measures, including the restriction of all non-essential travel and minimized discretionary expenses and consulting services. The Company continues to review operating expenses, including prioritizing certain R&D investments in support of the Company’s long-term growth objectives.
The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this 2020 Annual Report.
During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy experienced substantial turmoil, which led to challenging market conditions across certain areas of the Company’s business and, in part, contributed to an overall reduction in demand for the Company’s products. In addition, due to unprecedented decreases in demand, an oil price war, and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, average crude oil prices were considerably lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. However, since May 2020 through the date of this 2020 Annual Report, crude oil prices have increased. A significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. In early 2021, the Company experienced delays in its supply chain due to temporary shortages of raw materials and container delays of overseas materials as bottlenecks occurred at ports in Asia and North America. This, in turn, has caused delivery delays to some of the Company’s customers. The Company is also experiencing inflationary cost pressures for certain materials and is working to mitigate the impact through price increases and other measures, where possible. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact that may result in the recognition of material impairments or other related charges.
The Company expects its sales and profitability for the full year of 2021 to be above 2020 levels as a result of anticipated growth across all of its end markets. As compared to 2020, the sales growth is projected to occur in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021. Notwithstanding this positive outlook, which is being driven in part by expectations for improved economic conditions within the United States and across the Company’s various markets, the Company cautions that significant uncertainty still remains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
GM 6.0L Engine Offering: The Company had an exclusive third-party agreement with GM through December 31, 2019 to purchase and distribute GM 6.0L engines to on-highway customers. With the GM announcement that it will discontinue its production of the GM 6.0L engine, the Company conducted last-time buys of this engine during 2019 and 2020, and anticipates some additional purchases during 2021, to ensure adequate supply to certain transportation customers. The Company anticipates robust sales of this product during 2021. However, with the anticipated exhaustion of its inventory for a particular customer near the end of 2021, future sales to this customer are anticipated to decline as sales of the GM 6.0L to this customer will cease. For other customers, the Company anticipates that it will have a certain stock of pre-purchased GM 6.0L engines in inventory for future sales. The Company does not have a supply agreement with GM for its successor product to the GM 6.0L engine. However, the Company is actively exploring opportunities to identify engine alternatives for this product. In relation to these last-time buys, the Company had a net positive cash impact from customer prepayments of approximately $9.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
Hyster-Yale Supply Arrangement: The Company had a multi-year supply agreement with Hyster-Yale, which ended December 31, 2018, for the supply of a range of engines at certain specified volume levels. Since the beginning of 2019, the Company has continued to supply products to Hyster-Yale while the two parties continued to negotiate a new agreement. The Company is nearing the completion of a renewed supply agreement; however, Hyster-Yale has indicated that it will be obtaining alternative supply beginning in late 2021 for several high-volume engines that the Company currently provides, including the 2.0L and 2.4L engines sourced from the Company’s supplier SAME. As a result of this, the Company expects to see a decline in sales volumes to Hyster-Yale in 2022 and 2023. The Company believes it is positioned to continue its relationship in a moderated capacity with this customer in 2023 and beyond.
Strategic Initiatives/Growth Strategies: The Company has initiated a set of business objectives aimed at improving profitability, streamlining processes, strengthening the business and focusing on achieving growth in higher-return product lines. Central to this plan is the Company’s increased emphasis on energy product offerings through new product development and investments, in addition to leveraging the Company’s relationship with Weichai. With the introduction of numerous natural gas and diesel engines in 2019 and 2020, coupled with its existing strong product lineup, despite economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company believes that it has a solid foundation to achieve long-term growth, particularly within the energy market.
Results of Operations
Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019:
NM Not meaningful
* See reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results below
Net Sales
Net sales decreased $128.4 million, or 24%, in 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of sales decreases of $73.5 million, $49.1 million and $5.9 million in the energy, industrial, and transportation end markets, respectively. Lower energy end market sales were driven by decreased demand for the Company’s power generation products, especially those used within the oil and gas industry. The decreased sales within the industrial end market reflects lower demand for products used across a wide range of applications, with the largest decreases attributable to those products used in the material handling/forklift and arbor care markets. The decrease in transportation end market sales was primarily due to lower medium duty truck market business, in part driven by the inclusion of approximately $30 million of sales associated with the shipment of certain engines at the request of one of the Company’s customers (Freightliner) during the 2019 period, which impacted sales volume in 2020. Partly offsetting the lower transportation sales were increases in the school bus and terminal tractor markets.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased by $41.4 million, or 41%, to $58.4 million in 2020, compared to $99.9 million in 2019. Gross margin was 14.0% and 18.3% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in gross margin is primarily due to higher warranty expenses, unfavorable product mix and the impact of lower sales, partly mitigated by cost savings driven by reductions in the production facility workforce and other actions, as well as favorable tariff costs. For 2020, warranty costs were $19.5 million (net of supplier recoveries of $7.5 million), including an $8.7 million charge for adjustments to preexisting warranties, an increase of $9.4 million compared to warranty costs of $10.1 million (net of supplier recoveries of $3.0 million), including $2.7 million for adjustments to preexisting warranties. The increase in warranty expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to higher than expected claims experience for certain engines sold to customers primarily within the transportation end market.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses
Research, development and engineering expenses in 2020 were $25.4 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 2%, from 2019 levels, primarily as a result of increased spending on project activity during the year, partly offset by the impact of cost savings actions.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) decreased in 2020 by $2.4 million, or 4%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower financial reporting costs as a result of the completion of the restatement of the Company’s financial statements in May 2019, lower incentive compensation expense, the impact of cost savings actions, lower severance costs and lower key employee retention program costs. Partly offsetting the decline were higher legal costs related to the Company’s indemnification obligations of former officers and employees as a result of the exhaustion of its directors’ and officers’ insurance during the early part of 2020 (see additional discussion in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data), among other items.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $2.2 million to $5.7 million in 2020 from $7.9 million in 2019 largely due to lower overall interest rates on the Company’s debt in 2020, as compared to the prior year. Lower interest rates in 2020 were primarily due to refinancing the debt in April 2020. See Note 6. Debt, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.
Loss from Change in Value and Exercise of Warrants
There was no impact from a change in value of warrants for 2020 due to the Weichai Warrant being exercised in April 2019. The Company recognized a loss of $1.4 million in 2019 as a result of the change in the value of the Weichai Warrant including the impact of the exercise.
See Note 3. Weichai Transactions and Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.5 million. There was no loss on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2019.
See Note 6. Debt, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net increased by $0.6 million in 2020 primarily due to the receipt of life insurance proceeds upon the death of a former employee, partially offset by lower equity earnings from the Company’s joint venture.
Refer to Note 15. Related Party Transactions, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of the Company’s joint venture.
Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million in 2020, a decrease of $4.1 million, as compared to income tax expense of $0.4 million in 2019. The Company’s pretax loss was $26.7 million in 2020, compared to pretax income of $8.7 million in 2019. The increase in the tax benefit in 2020 is primarily attributable to the impact of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) enacted in the first quarter of 2020, which allowed the Company to elect bonus depreciation for the 2018 and 2019 tax years, carryback net operating losses to earlier years, and immediately refund Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) credits as well as a change in the deferred tax liability related to an indefinite-lived
intangible asset. The Company continues to record a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which offsets the tax benefits associated with the pre-tax loss for 2020.
See Note 11. Income Taxes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information related to the Company’s income tax provision.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) above, this report also includes non-GAAP (adjusted) financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide insight into selected financial information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated below.
The Company believes that Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted (loss) earnings per share, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in its industry as well as by the Company’s management in assessing the performance of the Company. Adjusted net (loss) income is defined as net income as adjusted for certain items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Adjusted (loss) earnings per share is a measure of the Company’s diluted net (loss) earnings per share adjusted for the impact of special items. EBITDA provides the Company with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of other non-cash and certain other items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations.
Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted (loss) earnings per share, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of the Company’s operations and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted net (loss) income, Adjusted (loss) earnings per share, and Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor because these measures are widely used to evaluate companies’ operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measures, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, the book value of assets, the capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired, among other factors. They are not, however, intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
During 2020, the Company changed the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to separate incremental financial reporting and government investigation expenses into: (1) incremental financial reporting, (2) internal control remediation, and (3) government investigations and other legal matters. In addition, the Company changed the presentation of non-GAAP adjustments for the comparative periods of 2019 in order to align to the current period presentation. There was no impact to Adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted earnings (loss) per share, EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of this change in presentation. The Company believes the updated presentation may provide more useful information to investors regarding the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments and better aligns with management’s use of the information.
The following table presents a reconciliation from Net (loss) income to Adjusted net (loss) income:
The following table presents a reconciliation from (Loss) earnings per common share - diluted to Adjusted (loss) earnings per share:

Commitments and Contingencies of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Company fully exhausted its historical primary directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage in connection with these matters during the first quarter of 2020. The amounts include $7.1 million for 2020 related to indemnification of certain former officers and employees.
10.Amount represents a life insurance payment to the Company related to the death of a former employee.
11.Amount consists of the impact of the CARES Act and a change in the deferred tax liability related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
Cash Flows
Cash was impacted as follows:
2020 Cash Flows
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operations was $7.6 million in 2020 compared to net cash provided by operations of $18.2 million in 2019 resulting in an increase of $25.8 million in cash used in operating activities year-over-year. This was primarily due to an increase in the net loss of $31.2 million and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $3.6 million partly offset by an increase in cash generated from working capital of $9.1 million. During 2020, working capital requirements resulted in a cash inflow of $6.2 million compared to a cash outflow of $2.9 million in 2019. The net cash inflow from working capital in 2020 was primarily due to lower accounts receivable due to collections during the year partly offset by a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million in 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.7 million in 2019 resulting in a decrease of $2.3 million of net cash used in investing activities year-over-year. Cash flows from investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $2.4 million compared to capital expenditures of $3.7 million in 2019. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2020 was partially offset by cash receipts from a corporate-owned life insurance policy which did not occur in 2019.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
The Company generated $33.3 million in cash for financing activities in 2020 compared to $14.6 million in cash used by financing activities in 2019, resulting in an increase of $47.8 million in cash generated by financing activities year over year. Primary cash inflows in 2020 were $90.5 million in net borrowings of the revolving line of credit partly offset by $57.3 million related to repayments of long-term debt and financing costs. See Note 6. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion. Cash used in financing activities in 2019 primarily related to net repayments of the revolving line credit of $15.1 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On April 2, 2020, the Company closed on its new senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement with Standard Chartered, which allowed the Company to borrow up to $130.0 million, and matures on March 26, 2021. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the alternate base rate or LIBOR plus 2.00%, and the Company is required to pay a 0.25% commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets and includes certain financial covenants as well as a change of control provision. On April 2, 2020, the Company borrowed $95.0 million under the Credit Agreement and utilized the funds to (i) repay the outstanding balance of $16.8 million under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, (ii) fully redeem and discharge $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Senior Notes and pay related interest, and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement was terminated in connection with the repayment of the outstanding balance. On April 29, 2020, the Company borrowed an additional $35.0 million under the Credit Agreement, which is the remaining portion of availability, providing the Company with greater financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowings outstanding of $130.0 million under the Credit Agreement and a cash balance of $21.0 million. These amounts reflect a net positive cash impact from customer prepayments of $9.3 million.
As discussed further in Item 8. Note 6. Debt, the Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which were effective for the Company beginning with the six months ended June 30, 2020. The financial covenants include an interest coverage ratio and a minimum EBITDA threshold as further defined in the Credit Agreement. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company did not meet the defined minimum EBITDA requirement. A breach of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement constitutes an event of default. On December 28, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment waived the financial covenant defaults noted herein and, among other things, removed the 60-day extension option, amended the calculation of the interest coverage ratio and minimum EBITDA and adjusted the interest coverage ratio and minimum EBITDA levels. The $130 million aggregate commitment amount of the Credit Agreement, maturity date of March 26, 2021, and applicable interest rate of the Credit Agreement remained unchanged.
In connection with the Amendment, the Company also entered into the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement between the Company and Weichai. Pursuant to the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement, Weichai has established an unsecured and uncommitted loan facility in favor of the Company in a maximum principal amount of $130.0 million. The Shareholder’s Loan Agreement matures on April 20, 2021. Loans may be made to the Company pursuant to the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement at Weichai’s sole discretion. The proceeds of any loans made under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement shall be used to repay existing obligations under the Credit Agreement. Any potential borrowings under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement would bear interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum.
In March 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement between the Company and Standard Chartered, as administrative agent. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement continues to allow the Company to borrow up to $130.0 million and matures on March 25, 2022. Under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, Standard Chartered has the right to demand payment of any and all outstanding borrowings and other amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement at any point in time at its discretion. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company entered into the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement, that is an amendment to the agreement originally executed with Weichai in December 2020. The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement provides the Company with access to $130.0 million of credit solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement. The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement provides Standard Chartered with a power of attorney (“POA”) to submit a borrowing request to Weichai under the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement if the Company fails to submit a borrowing request within five business days of receiving a request from Standard Chartered. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $130.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Note 6. Debt for further information regarding the terms and conditions of the Company’s debt agreements.
Significant uncertainties exist about the Company’s ability to refinance, extend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness, maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, and maintain compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement. Without additional financing, the Company anticipates that it will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to repay the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement as it becomes due. Management currently plans to seek additional liquidity from its current or other lenders before March 25, 2022. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully complete a refinancing on acceptable terms or repay this outstanding indebtedness when required or if at all.
Additionally, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the global economy experienced substantial turmoil including impacts from the world financial markets which have experienced a period of significant volatility and overall declines. In addition, due to unprecedented decreases in demand, an oil price war, and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil prices declined considerably during 2020 compared to the end of 2019. A significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. While the Company did not experience significant supply chain interruptions or material cancellations of orders during 2020, the Company did see a decline in orders and lower volumes compared to the prior year. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact that may result in the recognition of impairments or other related charges. Moreover, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations and liquidity continues to evolve.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the Company’s future ability to refinance, extend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness, maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, and maintain compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement in the future, substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. If the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, the Company had six outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.3 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements and the outstanding letters of credit.
Commitments and Contingencies
Legal matters are further discussed in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of legal risks to the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are
based on information available when they are made and, therefore, may differ from estimates made under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion of accounting policies that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue Recognition
The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations.
Revenue for the Company is generated from contracts that may include a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. Revenue is measured at the transaction price which is based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company is required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. The consideration expected to be received may be variable based on the specific terms of the contract and the Company’s past practices.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the total transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on directly observable data, if available, or the Company’s best estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct performance obligation. The primary method used to estimate the stand-alone selling price is the cost plus a margin approach.
The Company applies significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance obligations, determine the total transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, and determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.
The Company’s payment terms are less than one year, and its sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing components.
Timing of revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue related to performance obligations in its contracts with customers when control passes to the customer. Control passes to the customer when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. For the majority of the Company’s products, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the products are shipped or delivered to the customer based on the shipping terms as that is the point in time when control passes to the customer.
The Company also recognizes revenue over time primarily when the Company’s performance obligations include: enhancing a customer-controlled asset (generally when an engine is provided by the customer), constructing an asset with no alternative future use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment throughout the period as the services are performed or providing an extended warranty beyond the Company’s standard warranty. The Company recognizes revenue throughout the manufacturing process when constructing an asset based on labor hours incurred because the customer receives the benefit of the asset as the product is constructed. The Company believes labor hours incurred relative to total estimated labor hours at completion faithfully depicts the transfer of control to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue related to extended warranty programs based on the passage of time over the extended warranty period.
Inventories
The Company’s inventories consist primarily of engines and parts. Engines are valued at the lower of cost plus estimated freight-in or net realizable value. Parts are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or net realizable value. Net realizable value approximates replacement cost.
It is the Company’s policy to review inventories on a continuous basis for obsolete, excess and slow-moving items and to record valuation adjustments for such items in order to eliminate non-recoverable costs from inventory. The Company writes down inventory for an estimated amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated realizable value. Additionally, an inventory reserve is provided based upon the Company’s estimate of future demand for the quantity of inventory on hand. In determining an estimate of future demand, multiple factors are taken into consideration, including (i) customer purchase orders and customer projected demand, (ii) historical sales/usage for each inventory item and (iii) utilization
within a current or anticipated future power system. These factors are primarily based upon quantifiable information, and therefore the Company has not experienced significant differences in inventory valuation due to variances in the Company’s estimation of future demand.
Goodwill Impairment
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the values assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist.
The Company performs its annual impairment test using the discounted cash flow method which involves the Company’s management making estimates with respect to a variety of factors that will significantly impact the future performance of the business, including the following:
•future volume projections;
•estimated margins on sales;
•estimated growth rate for SG&A costs;
•future effective tax rate; and
•weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”) used to discount future performance of the Company.
Because these estimates form a basis for the determination of whether or not the impairment charge should be recorded, these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. The Company completed its 2020 annual impairment test as of October 1, 2020 and concluded that there were no impairments. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $29.8 million of goodwill. Significant adverse changes to the Company’s business environment and future cash flows could cause the recognition of impairment charges, which could be material, in future periods. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global economy, it is reasonably possible that the Company will continue to be adversely impacted which may result in the recognition of material goodwill impairment charges.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill which is separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Potential indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, an asset remaining idle for more than a short period of time, advances in technology, or plans to discontinue use of, or change, in the business model for the operation in which a long-lived asset is used. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the Company then calculates an impairment loss. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the long-lived asset’s carrying value with its estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The Company also periodically reevaluates the useful lives of its long-lived assets due to advances and changes in its technologies.
The Company’s impairment loss calculations contain critical estimates because they require the Company’s management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and long-lived asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the long-lived assets and selecting discount rates.
If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the Company could experience an impairment triggering event and be exposed to losses that could be material. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global economy, it is reasonably possible that the Company will continue to be adversely impacted which may result in the recognition of material impairment charges related to its long-lived assets.
Warranty
The Company offers a standard limited warranty on the workmanship of its products that in most cases covers defects for a defined period. Warranties for certified emission products are mandated by the EPA and/or the CARB and are generally longer than the Company’s standard warranty on certain emission-related products. The Company’s products may also carry limited warranties from suppliers. The Company’s warranties generally apply to engines fully manufactured by the Company and to the modifications the Company makes to supplier base products. Costs related to supplier warranty claims are often times borne by the supplier and passed through to the end customer. The Company estimates and records a liability and related charges to income for its warranty program at the time products are sold to customers. Estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management’s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold. The Company’s warranty liability is generally affected by failure rates, repair costs and the timing of failures. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change the estimates and require adjustments to the warranty liability. In addition, new product
launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had warranty reserves of $31.5 million.
The Company records adjustments to preexisting warranties for changes in its estimate of warranty costs for products sold in prior fiscal years in the period in which it is determined that actual costs may differ from the Company’s initial or previous estimates. Such adjustments typically occur when new information received by the Company indicates claims experience deviates from historical and expected trends. During 2020, the Company recognized a charge for adjustments to preexisting warranties of $8.7 million compared to a charge of $2.7 million in 2019.
When the Company identifies cost effective opportunities to address issues in products sold or corrective actions for safety issues, it initiates product recalls or field campaigns. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recalls and field campaigns, the liability for such actions is generally recorded when the Company commits to a product recall or field campaign. In each subsequent quarter after a recall or field campaign is initiated, the recorded warranty liability balance is analyzed, reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to reflect any changes in the anticipated average cost of repair or number of repairs to be completed prospectively.
When collection is reasonably assured, the Company also estimates the amount of warranty claim recoveries to be received from its suppliers. Warranty costs and recoveries are included in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes the assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. Valuation allowances are established when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered. A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent to which, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $48.1 million and $41.7 million, respectively. Although the Company believes that its approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ, and the Company may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material. See Note 11. Income Taxes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information regarding the deferred tax valuation allowance.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Stockholders and Board of Directors
Power Solutions International, Inc.
Wood Dale, Illinois
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Power Solutions International, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Uncertainty
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, significant uncertainties exist about the Company’s ability to refinance, extend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness and maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition from Significant Supply Agreements
As more fully described in Note 2. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue from significant supply agreements with two customers of $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company also had contract liabilities of $46.4 million related to these significant supply agreements as of December 31, 2020. The contracts executed under these two significant supply agreements included complex revenue recognition considerations. Additionally, during 2020, the Company began licensing its technology to a third-party manufacturer to produce and certify certain products purchased through these contracts, which required additional consideration to determine if the Company remained the principal in the contract.
We identified revenue recognition from contracts executed under these significant customer supply agreements as a critical audit matter. Significant judgment was required to determine the performance obligations within the contracts, when control of
the performance obligations transfers to the customer, and whether the Company is a principal or agent in satisfying the performance obligations. Auditing these aspects involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including specialized skill and knowledge needed.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
a.Evaluating the appropriateness of management’s revenue recognition accounting policies and practices applied to these significant supply agreements.
b.Examining the terms of the contracts executed under the significant supply agreements, including the licensing contract with the third-party manufacturer, and evaluating management’s judgment about:
i.whether contract promises represented performance obligations
ii.when control of each performance obligation transfers to the customer and
iii.whether the Company was a principal or agent in satisfying the performance obligations.
c.Testing a sample of revenue transactions for each contract to evaluate whether the revenue recognized and contract liabilities recorded were consistent with management’s accounting policies and practices.
d.Utilizing personnel with specialized skill and knowledge in evaluating complex revenue transactions to evaluate the application of management’s revenue recognition accounting policies and generally accepted accounting principles specifically related to the identification of performance obligations, the timing of when control of the performance obligation transfers to the customer and whether the Company was a principal or an agent in satisfying the performance obligations in these significant supply agreements.
Transportation Accrued Product Warranty
As more fully described in Note 1. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated accrued product warranty balance was $31.5 million as of December 31, 2020, which included the transportation accrued product warranty covering new products launched in recent years. The Company offers a standard limited warranty on the workmanship of its products. The Company estimates and records a liability and related charges to income for its warranty program at the time products are sold to customers. These estimates are established using historical warranty claims information including failure rates, repair costs and timing of failures. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Previous estimates are adjusted as actual warranty claims data becomes available.
We identified the transportation accrued product warranty liability as a critical audit matter. Auditing management’s estimates and assumptions to determine the transportation accrued product warranty liability involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the limited availability of historical warranty claims information for new transportation products launched in recent years.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
a.Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions to estimate the future warranty claims for the recently developed and launched transportation products by:
i.Comparing assumptions used to estimate the transportation accrued product warranty to those of a similar product line for periods when historical claims are not available, including assessing reasonableness of the similarity of such products by understanding their nature and intended use.
ii.Comparing the current transportation product warranty claims estimates to the prior year estimates and investigating significant differences.
iii.Analyzing the trends from historical transportation product sales and claims received from those sales to evaluate changes in the failure rates, repair costs and timing of failures for more recent sales of products and verifying that these trends are reasonably incorporated in management’s current estimates.
b.Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying historical warranty claims information used to estimate future warranty claims.
c.Testing the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of the transportation product warranty.
d.Analyzing current period warranty claims data for indicators that historical trends may not be indicative of future warranty claims for the same transportation products.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information
Nature of Business Operations
Power Solutions International, Inc. (“Power Solutions,” “PSI” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a global producer and distributor of a broad range of high-performance, certified, low-emission power systems, including alternative-fueled power systems for original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of off-highway industrial equipment and certain on-road vehicles and large custom-engineered integrated electrical power generation systems.
The Company’s customers include large, industry-leading and multinational organizations. The Company’s products and services are sold predominantly to customers throughout North America as well as to customers located throughout the Pacific Rim and Europe. The Company’s power systems are highly engineered, comprehensive systems which, through the Company’s technologically sophisticated development and manufacturing processes, including its in-house design, prototyping, testing and engineering capabilities and its analysis and determination of the specific components to be integrated into a given power system (driven in large part by emission standards and cost considerations), allow the Company to provide its customers with power systems customized to meet specific OEM application requirements, other technical customers’ specifications and requirements imposed by environmental regulatory bodies.
The Company’s power system configurations range from a basic engine integrated with appropriate fuel system components to completely packaged power systems that include any combination of cooling systems, electronic systems, air intake systems, fuel systems, housings, power takeoff systems, exhaust systems, hydraulic systems, enclosures, brackets, hoses, tubes and other assembled componentry. The Company also designs and manufactures large, custom-engineered integrated electrical power generation systems for both standby and prime power applications. The Company purchases engines from third-party suppliers and produces internally designed engines, all of which are then integrated into its power systems.
Of the other components that the Company integrates into its power systems, a substantial portion consist of internally designed components and components for which it coordinates significant design efforts with third-party suppliers, with the remainder consisting largely of parts that are sourced off-the-shelf from third-party suppliers. Some of the key components (including purchased engines) embody proprietary intellectual property of the Company’s suppliers. As a result of its design and manufacturing capabilities, the Company is able to provide its customers with a power system that can be incorporated into a customer’s specified application. In addition to the certified products described above, the Company sells diesel, gasoline and non-certified power systems and aftermarket components.
Stock Ownership and Control
In March 2017, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Weichai America Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Weichai Power Co., Ltd. (HK2338, SZ000338) (herein collectively referred to as “Weichai”). Under the terms of the SPA, Weichai invested $60.0 million in the Company purchasing a combination of newly issued Common and Preferred Stock as well as a stock purchase warrant (the “Weichai Warrant”).
With the exercise of the Weichai Warrant in April 2019, Weichai owns a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result, Weichai is able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholders’ approval, including the election of the directors, amendment of the Company’s Charter and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions impractical without the support of Weichai.
Weichai also entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) with the Company upon execution of the SPA. The Rights Agreement provides Weichai with representation on the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and management representation rights. Weichai currently has four representatives on the Board, which constitutes the majority of the directors serving on the Board. According to the Rights Agreement, during any period when the Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) Listing Rules, it will take such measures as to avail itself of the “controlled company” exemptions available under Rule 5615 of the NASDAQ Listing Rules of Rules 5605(b), (d) and (e).
Going Concern Considerations
In March 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated uncommitted revolving credit agreement between the Company and Standard Chartered Bank (“Standard Chartered”), as administrative agent (the “Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement continues to allow the Company to borrow up to $130.0 million and matures on March 25, 2022. Under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, Standard Chartered has the right to demand payment of any and all
outstanding borrowings and other amounts outstanding under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement at any point in time at its discretion. In connection with the execution of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the shareholder’s loan agreement originally executed with Weichai in December 2020 (the “First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement”). The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement provides the Company with access to $130.0 million of credit solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement. The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement expires on April 25, 2022. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement provides Standard Chartered with a power of attorney (“POA”) to submit a borrowing request to Weichai under the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement if the Company fails to submit a borrowing request within five business days of receiving a request from Standard Chartered. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $130.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Note 6. Debt for further information regarding the terms and conditions of the Company’s debt agreements.
Significant uncertainties exist about the Company’s ability to refinance, extend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness, maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, and maintain compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement in the future. Without additional financing, the Company anticipates that it will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to repay amounts owing under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement as it becomes due. In order to provide the Company with a more permanent source of liquidity, management plans to seek an extension and amendment and/or replacement of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement or additional liquidity from its current or other lenders before March 25, 2022. There can be no assurance that the Company’s management will be able to successfully complete an extension and amendment of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement or obtain new financing on acceptable terms, when required or if at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the Company’s efforts to address these issues.
Furthermore, if the Company cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, it may not, among other things, be able to do the following:
•continue to expand the Company’s research and product investments and sales and marketing organization;
•continue to fund and expand operations both organically and through acquisitions; and
•respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Additionally, as discussed further below, in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 outbreak”) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic”), based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may continue to have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Company.
The Company’s management has concluded that, due to uncertainties surrounding the Company’s future ability to refinance, extend and amend, or repay its outstanding indebtedness, maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its business activities, and maintain compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, substantial doubt exists as to its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. The Company’s plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern may not be successful, and it may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplating the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on generating profitable operating results, having sufficient liquidity, maintaining compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement in the future, and extending and amending, refinancing or repaying the indebtedness outstanding under this agreement.
Recent COVID-19 Outbreak and Oil and Gas Market Price Volatility
During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy experienced substantial turmoil, which led to challenging market conditions across certain areas of the Company’s business. In addition, due to unprecedented decreases in demand, an oil price war, and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, average crude oil prices were considerably lower in 2020 as compared to prices at the end of 2019. However, since May 2020 and through the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, crude oil prices have increased. A significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. While the Company did not experience significant supply chain interruptions or material cancellations of orders during 2020, the Company did see a decline
in orders and lower volumes compared to the prior year. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact on the timing of delivery of customer orders and the levels of future customer orders. Accordingly, challenges may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As of March 31, 2020, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil and gas market price volatility. Based on this interim assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2020. As further discussed in Note 5., Goodwill and Other Intangibles, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2020 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. It is reasonably possible that potential adverse impacts of the factors noted above could result in the recognition of material impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets or other related charges in future periods as the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting effect on the Company’s operations continues to evolve and remains uncertain.
The Company initiated certain contingency actions during 2020 as a result of the significant negative impacts of these factors. During 2020, the Company took actions to continue to improve its manufacturing operations which included making reductions in its production facility workforce to align with current volume trends. In addition, the Company implemented various temporary cost reduction measures, including reduced pay for salaried employees, suspension of the 401(k) match program, and deferred spending on certain research and development (“R&D”) programs, among others. Any additional cost savings initiatives or other cash actions the Company undertakes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not achieve the intended results and may result in other adverse impacts, which could be material. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the Company may continue to experience negative impacts to its business, operations and financial condition as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Power Solutions International, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of all wholly owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company exercises control. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company operates as one business and geographic operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of a business that can earn revenues and incur expenses for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The Company’s CODM is its principal executive officer, who decides how to allocate resources and assess performance. A single management team reports to the CODM, who manages the entire business. The Company’s CODM reviews consolidated statements of operations to make decisions, allocate resources and assess performance, and the CODM does not evaluate the profit or loss from any separate geography or product line.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts recorded in the prior-period consolidated financial statements presented have been reclassified to conform to the current-period financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of allowances for uncollectible receivables, inventory reserves, warranty reserves, stock-based compensation, evaluation of goodwill, other intangibles, plant and equipment for impairment, and determination of useful lives of long-lived assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments that mature within three months or less. Such investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Restricted Cash
The Company is required to maintain minimum levels of cash collateral to support the letters of credit. The cash collateral is held in a separate bank account which the Company is restricted from accessing. As discussed in Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $2.3 million and restricted cash of $3.3 million at December 31, 2020.
Research and Development
R&D expenses are expensed when incurred. R&D expenses consist primarily of wages, materials, testing and consulting related to the development of new engines, parts and applications. These costs were $24.3 million and $23.3 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.
The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting guidance, on the basis of a two-step process whereby (i) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of
limitations remains open, or the statute of limitation has expired. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of income tax expense and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable represent amounts billed to customers and not yet collected. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net recoverable value, and generally do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable and is established through a charge to selling, general and administrative expenses. The allowance is primarily determined based on historical collection experience and reviews of customer creditworthiness. Trade accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed on a regular basis. When necessary, an allowance for the full amount of specific accounts deemed uncollectible is recorded. Accounts receivable losses are deducted from the allowance and the account balance is written off when the customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of previously written off balances are recognized when received. An allowance associated with anticipated future sales returns is also included in the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Inventories
The Company’s inventories consist primarily of engines and parts. Engines are valued at the lower of cost plus estimated freight-in or net realizable value. Parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value approximates replacement cost. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first-out method and includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead. It is the Company’s policy to review inventories on a continuing basis for obsolete, excess and slow-moving items and to record valuation adjustments for such items in order to eliminate non-recoverable costs from inventory. Valuation adjustments are recorded in an inventory reserve account and reduce the cost basis of the inventory in the period in which the reduced valuation is determined. Inventory reserves are established based on quantities on hand, usage and sales history, customer orders, projected demand and utilization within a current or future power system. Specific analysis of individual items or groups of items is performed based on these same criteria, as well as on changes in market conditions or any other identified conditions.
Inventories consist of the following:
Activity in the Company’s inventory allowance was as follows:
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and presented net of accumulated depreciation and impairments. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Property, plant and equipment is evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment to depreciable lives is warranted. Such evaluation is based principally on the expected utilization of the long-lived assets.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.
Estimated useful lives by each type of asset category are as follows:
Intangible Assets
The Company’s intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technology, trade names and trademarks. Intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of time that approximates the pattern over which the Company expects to gain the estimated economic benefits, and such period generally ranges between three years and 15 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets or asset groups, excluding goodwill which is separately tested for impairment, whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group, including cash flows from disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is calculated. An impairment loss is determined by the amount that the asset’s or asset group’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. If an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted balance becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life. The Company also periodically reassesses the useful lives of its long-lived assets due to advances and changes in technologies.
As a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global economy, it is reasonably possible that the Company will be adversely impacted in future periods which may result in the recognition of material impairment charges related to its long-lived assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net acquired assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis or more frequently, if events occur or circumstances change indicating potential impairment. The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on October 1.
In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., there is a likelihood of more than 50%) that the Company’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that the Company considers include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment, or if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment it will recognize, if any.
In the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its related carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is needed. If, however, the reporting unit’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company records an impairment for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value.
The Company calculates its estimated fair value using the income and market approaches when feasible, or an asset approach when neither the income nor the market approach has sufficient data. For the income approach, a discounted cash flow method, the Company uses internally developed discounted cash flow models that include the following assumptions, among others: projections of revenues, expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends, expected future investments to grow new units, and estimated discount rates. The Company based these assumptions on its historical data and experience, industry projections, and micro and macro general economic condition projections and expectations. The market approach, also called the Guideline Public Company Approach, compares the value of an entity to similar publicly traded companies. The asset approach estimates the selling price the unit could achieve under assumed market conditions.
During the first quarter of 2020, the Company considered the significant changes in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil and gas market price volatility in performing its assessment of whether an interim impairment review was required for any reporting units and determined that a triggering event had occurred as of March 31, 2020. The Company considered
both qualitative and quantitative factors in its assessment including the significant amount of headroom resulting from the prior fiscal year’s impairment test and potential changes in key assumptions, including discount rates, expected profitability and long-term growth rates, used in the last fiscal year’s impairment analysis that may have been impacted by the recent market conditions and economic events. Based on this interim assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2020.
The Company has historically had two reporting units: PSI and Professional Power Products, Inc. (“3PI”). Due to organizational leadership changes as well as operational changes implemented at both PSI and 3PI that further consolidated and integrated operations of the reporting units, the Company concluded that there was only a single reporting unit for purposes of conducting the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2020. The single reporting unit represents the consolidated operating segment. With the change from two reporting units to one, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test immediately before and after the change. The Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of immediate before and after combining the reporting units; as such, no impairment charges were recognized. It is reasonably possible that potential adverse impacts of the factors noted above that triggered an interim assessment in the first quarter of 2020 could result in the recognition of material impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets or other related charges in future periods as the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting effect on the Company’s operations continues to evolve and remains uncertain.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed a quantitative assessment and determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value; as such, no impairment charges were recognized.
As a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the global economy, it is reasonably possible that the Company will be adversely impacted in future periods which may result in the recognition of material goodwill impairment charges.
Other Accrued Liabilities
Other accrued liabilities consisted of the following:
*As of December 31, 2020, litigation reserves related to various ongoing legal matters including associated legal fees. As of December 31, 2019, litigation reserves primarily consisted of accruals for the settlement of the SEC and USAO Investigations and the Federal Derivative Litigation. The Company concluded that insurance recovery was probable related to $1.9 million of the litigation reserves as of December 31, 2019, and recognized full recovery of the settlement amounts in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.
Warranty Costs
The Company offers a standard limited warranty on the workmanship of its products that in most cases covers defects for a defined period. Warranties for certified emission products are mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and / or the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) and are longer than the Company’s standard warranty on certain emission-related products. The Company’s products also carry limited warranties from suppliers. The Company’s warranties generally apply to engines fully manufactured by the Company and to the modifications the Company makes to supplier base products. Costs related to supplier warranty claims are generally borne by the supplier and passed through to the end customer.
Warranty estimates are based on historical experience and represent the projected cost associated with the product. A liability and related expense are recognized at the time products are sold. The Company adjusts estimates when it is determined that actual costs may differ from initial or previous estimates. The Company’s warranty liability is generally affected by failure rates, repair costs and the timing of failures. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change the estimates and require adjustments to the warranty liability. In addition, new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available.
The Company records adjustments to preexisting warranties for changes in its estimate of warranty costs for products sold in prior fiscal years in the period in which new information is received and the information indicates that actual costs may differ from the Company’s initial or previous estimates. Such adjustments typically occur when claims experience deviates from historic and expected trends.
When the Company identifies cost effective opportunities to address issues in products sold or corrective actions for safety issues, it initiates product recalls or field campaigns. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recalls and field campaigns, the liability for such actions is generally recorded when the Company commits to a product recall or field campaign. In each subsequent quarter after a recall or field campaign is initiated, the recorded warranty liability balance is analyzed, reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to reflect any changes in the anticipated average cost of repair or number of repairs to be completed prospectively.
When collection is reasonably assured, the Company also estimates the amount of warranty claim recoveries to be received from its suppliers. Warranty costs and recoveries are included in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Accrued product warranty activities are presented below:
*Warranty costs, net of supplier recoveries, were $19.5 million and $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Supplier recoveries were $7.5 million and $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
**Change in estimates for preexisting warranties reflect changes in the Company’s estimate of warranty costs for products sold in prior periods. Such adjustments typically occur when claims experience deviates from historic and expected trends. The Company’s warranty liability is generally affected by failure rates, repair costs and the timing of failures. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change the estimates and require adjustments to the warranty liability. In addition, new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. The Company recorded charges for changes in estimates for preexisting warranties of $8.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, and $2.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Revenue Recognition

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This guidance requires the use of existing accounting guidance applicable to software developed for internal use to be applied to cloud computing service contracts’ implementation costs. The costs capitalized would be amortized over the life of the agreement, including renewal option periods likely to be used. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. There was no impact on the Company’s financial statements including the related notes as a result of adopting the guidance.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which both reduces and expands selected disclosure requirements. The principal changes expected to impact the Company’s disclosure are requirements to disclose the range and weighted average of each of the significant unobservable items and the way the weighted average of a range is calculated for items in the “table of significant unobservable inputs.” The guidance also requires disclosure of changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income and removes requirements regarding, among other items, disclosure of the valuation process for Level 3 measurements. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020. There was no impact on the Company’s financial statements including the related notes as a result of adopting the guidance.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminated the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The ASU is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods beginning after December 15, 2019;
early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. There was no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Statements of Cash Flows or Statement of Stockholders’ Equity as a result of the adoption.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provided optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendment allows entities to elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. The guidance was effective upon issuance and expires after December 31, 2022. There was no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Statements of Cash Flows or Statement of Stockholders’ Equity as a result of this guidance. The Company continues to monitor contracts potentially impacted by reference rate reform, including the Company’s debt agreements, and will continue to assess the potential impacts of this guidance as reference rates are updated.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which applies primarily to the Company’s accounts receivable impairment loss allowances. The guidance provides a revised model whereby the current expected credit losses are used to compute impairment of financial instruments. The new model requires evaluation of historical experience and various current and expected factors, which may affect the estimated amount of losses and requires determination of whether the affected financial instruments should be grouped in units of account. The guidance, as originally issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842) Effective Dates, which deferred the effective dates of these standards for certain entities. Based on the guidance, the effective date of ASU 2016-13 is deferred for the Company until fiscal year 2023. The Company currently plans to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2023 when it becomes effective. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the standard on its financial statements.
Note 2. Revenue
Revenue Recognition
The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•determination of the transaction price;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations.
Revenue for the Company is generated from contracts that may include a single performance obligation (generally, a single type of engine) or multiple performance obligations (which may include an engine with aftermarket parts, different types of engines, etc.). A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. Revenue is measured at the transaction price which is based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company is required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. The consideration expected to be received may be variable based on the specific terms of the contract and the Company’s past practices.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the total transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on directly observable data, if available, or the Company’s best estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct performance obligation. The primary method used to estimate stand-alone selling price is the cost plus a margin approach.
The Company applies significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance obligations, determine the total transaction price, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation, and determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition.
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is, such taxes are excluded from revenues.
The Company’s payment terms are generally 60 days or less and its sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing components.
Timing of revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue related to performance obligations in its contracts with customers when control passes to the customer. Control passes to the customer when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. For the majority of the Company’s products, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the products are shipped or delivered to the customer based on the shipping terms as that is the point in time when control passes to the customer. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $370.7 million and $489.0 million, respectively, related to products shipped or delivered at a point in time.
The Company also recognizes revenue over time primarily when the Company’s performance obligations include enhancing a customer-controlled asset (generally when an engine is provided by the customer), constructing an asset with no alternative future use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment throughout the period as the services are performed, or providing services over time such as an extended warranty beyond the Company’s standard warranty. The Company recognizes revenue throughout the manufacturing process when constructing an asset based on labor hours incurred because the customer receives the benefit of the asset as the product is constructed. The Company believes labor hours incurred relative to total estimated labor hours at completion faithfully depicts the transfer of control to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue related to extended warranty programs based on the passage of time over the extended warranty period. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $46.9 million and $57.1 million, respectively, for products manufactured and services provided over time.
Shipping and handling costs. The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs which are recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This includes shipping and handling costs incurred after control of the asset has transferred to the customer as the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606.
Principal vs. agent considerations. For transactions that involve more than one party when providing goods or services to a customer, the Company determines whether it is the principal or agent in these transactions by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. The analysis of whether the Company is a principal or an agent in a transaction is performed for each good or services provided to the customer. The Company determines whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer by considering the following factors:
a.Whether the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service.
b.Whether the Company has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to the customer or after transfer of control to the customer.
c.Whether the Company has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
If the Company determines that it is the principal in the transaction, it recognizes revenues at the gross transaction price for the good or service. If the Company determines that is an agent in the transaction, it recognizes revenue at the net amount of the transaction price.
The Company has two significant supply agreements with multiple performance obligations related to the sale of 6.0L engines. As a result of the Weichai ownership change in April 2019 (see additional discussion in Note 3. Weichai Transactions), the Company was required to be compliant with Phase 1 GHG standards beginning January 1, 2020 for its 6.0L and 8.8L engines. In order to address the impact of the transition of its emission regulation requirements in 2020 and 2021, the Company licensed its technology to a third-party small manufacturer to produce and certify the 6.0L gasoline engine and utilized averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for the sale of its 8.8L gasoline engine. As a result of outsourcing the production of the 6.0L gasoline engine, the Company considered whether it was the principal or agent in the transactions with its customers related to the 6.0L gasoline engine. With the exception of certain parts sold directly to customers, the Company concluded that it remained the principal in the transactions. The Company recognized revenue related to contracts with customers for 6.0L engines of $70.0 million in 2020.
Variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily includes rebates and discounts. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates and discounts based on current assumptions, customer-specific information and historical experience. Variable consideration is recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent that it is probable that there will not be significant changes to the Company’s estimate of variable consideration when any uncertainties are settled.
Costs to obtain and fulfill a contract. The Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize incremental costs to obtain a contract (primarily commissions) as expense when incurred since the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The following table summarizes net sales by end market:
The following table summarizes net sales by geographic area:
Contract Balances
Most of the Company’s contracts are for a period of less than one year; however, certain long-term manufacturing and extended warranty contracts extend beyond one year. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the time of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in contract assets, or contract liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contract assets include amounts related to the contractual right to consideration for completed performance when the right to consideration is conditional. The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Contract assets and contract liabilities are recognized at the contract level.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $30.8 million and $6.7 million of revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations related to amounts that were included in the net contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the contract liabilities from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 is primarily related to the prepayment for 6.0L gasoline engine by a customer under a long-term supply agreement. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had a contract liability related to prepayments of 6.0L gasoline engines of $46.4 million and $38.0 million, respectively.
Remaining Performance Obligations
The Company has elected the practical expedient to not disclose remaining performance obligations that have expected original durations of one year or less. For performance obligations that extend beyond one year, the Company had $50.1 million of remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 primarily related to a long-term manufacturing contract with a customer and extended warranties. The Company expects to recognize revenue related to these remaining performance obligations of approximately $46.9 million in 2021, $0.7 million in 2022, $1.0 million in 2023, $1.0 million in 2024 and $0.5 million in 2025 and beyond.
Note 3. Weichai Transactions
In March 2017, the Company and Weichai executed the SPA in which the Company issued stock and a warrant to Weichai for aggregate proceeds of $60.0 million (the “Weichai Transactions”), composed of the following:
•2,728,752 shares of Common Stock;
•2,385,624 shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Convertible Preferred Stock”) that was converted into 4,771,248 shares of Common Stock in November 2017; and
•the Weichai Warrant as discussed further below.
The Company used proceeds from the sale of the above securities pursuant to the SPA and borrowings under the Credit Agreement to pay off the outstanding TPG Term Loan (the “TPG Term Loan”) with TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. (“TPG”).
Weichai Warrant
In September 2018, the Weichai Warrant was amended under the terms of a second amended and restated warrant (“Amended and Restated Warrant”) to defer its exercise date to a 90-day period commencing April 1, 2019, to adjust the exercise price to a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of the Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) during the 20 consecutive trading day period preceding October 1, 2018 and (ii) 50% of the VWAP during the 20 consecutive trading day period preceding the date of exercise, subject to an adjustment that could reduce the exercise price by up to $15.0 million. In the event that the adjustment exceeded the exercise price, the excess would be due to the warrant holder.
On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and Weichai becoming the owner of 51.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, as of such date. The exercise proceeds for the warrants of $1.6 million were based on 50% of the VWAP during the 20 consecutive trading day period preceding April 23, 2019 and the $15.0 million reduction in the exercise price described above. The Company recorded net expense of $1.4 million related to the Weichai Warrant during 2019 including the impact of the exercise.
Weichai Shareholder’s Loan Agreement
In December 2020, the Company entered into the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement with Weichai. The Shareholder’s Loan Agreement was amended and restated in March 2021. See additional discussion in Note 6. Debt.
Weichai Collaboration Arrangement and Other Related Party Transactions
The Company and Weichai executed a strategic collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) on March 20, 2017, in order to achieve their respective strategic objectives and enhance the strategic cooperation alliance to share experiences, expertise and resources. Among other things, the collaboration arrangement established a joint steering committee, permitted Weichai to second a limited number of certain technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and established several collaborations, related to stationary natural-gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The collaboration arrangement provided for the steering committee to create various sub-committees with operating roles and otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement had a term of three years that was set to expire in March 2020. On March 26, 2020, the Collaboration Agreement was extended for an additional term of three years.
The Company evaluates whether an arrangement is a collaborative arrangement at its inception based on the facts and circumstances specific to the arrangement. The Company also reevaluates whether an arrangement qualifies or continues to qualify as a collaborative arrangement whenever there is a change in either the roles of the participants or the participants’ exposure to significant risks and rewards dependent on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor. For those collaborative arrangements where it is determined that the Company is the principal participant, costs incurred and revenue generated from third parties are recorded on a gross basis in the financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s sales to and outstanding receivables from Weichai were immaterial. The Company purchased $18.6 million and $4.4 million of inventory from Weichai during 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had outstanding payables to Weichai of $4.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment by type were as follows:
Note 5. Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $29.8 million. Accumulated impairment losses at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $11.6 million.
Other Intangible Assets
Components of intangible assets are as follows:
Estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:
Note 6. Debt
The Company’s outstanding debt consisted of the following:
* Unamortized financing costs and deferred fees on the Revolving Credit Facility are not presented in the above table as they are classified in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs, including gross waiver fees (primarily paid to the lenders), were $1.1 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company paid $4.2 million and $6.9 million in cash for interest in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Credit Agreement and Shareholders’ Loan Agreement
On April 2, 2020, the Company closed on its new senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement with Standard Chartered. The Credit Agreement allows the Company to borrow up to $130.0 million and matures on March 26, 2021 with an optional 60-day extension subject to certain conditions and payment of a 0.25% extension fee. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement shall bear interest at either the alternate base rate or LIBOR plus 2.00%, and the Company is required to pay a 0.25% commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets and includes certain financial covenants as well as a change of control provision. On April 2, 2020, the Company borrowed $95.0 million under the Credit Agreement and utilized the funds to (i) repay the outstanding balance of $16.8 million under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, (ii) fully redeem and discharge $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Senior Notes and pay related interest and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement was terminated in connection with the repayment of the outstanding balance. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement and the Unsecured Senior Notes of $0.5 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs and deferred additional debt issuance costs related to the closing of the Credit Agreement of $2.0 million.
As discussed above, the Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which were effective for the Company beginning with the six months ended June 30, 2020. The financial covenants include an interest coverage ratio and a minimum EBITDA threshold as further defined in the Credit Agreement. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company did not meet the defined minimum EBITDA requirement. A breach of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement constitutes an event of default and, if not cured or waived, could result in the obligations under the Credit Agreement being accelerated. On December 28, 2020, the Company entered into the Amendment, which waived the financial covenant defaults noted herein and, among other things, removed the 60-day extension option, amended the calculation of the interest coverage ratio and minimum EBITDA and adjusted the interest coverage ratio and minimum EBITDA levels. The $130.0 million aggregate commitment amount of the Credit Agreement, maturity date of March 26, 2021, and applicable interest rate of the Credit Agreement remained unchanged. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the revised covenants.
In connection with the Amendment, the Company also entered into the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement between the Company and Weichai. Pursuant to the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement, Weichai has established an unsecured and uncommitted loan facility in favor of the Company in a maximum principal amount of $100.0 million. The Shareholder’s Loan Agreement matures on April 20, 2021. Loans may be made to the Company pursuant to the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement at Weichai’s sole discretion. The proceeds of any loans made under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement shall be used to repay existing obligations under the Credit Agreement. Any potential borrowings under the Shareholder’s Loan Agreement would bear interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.50% per annum.
On March 26, 2021, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement with Standard Chartered to amend and restate the Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement continues to allow the Company to up to $130.0 million (all of which has been fully borrowed as December 31,
2020), is uncommitted, and matures on March 25, 2022. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement shall bear interest at either the alternate base rate or LIBOR plus 2.70%. In addition, the Company paid fees of $1.9 million related to the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, which will be deferred and amortized over the term of the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement continues to be secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets and includes financial covenants related to the Company’s financial performance for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2021. There are no financial covenants applicable to the first quarter of 2021. The Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement gives Standard Chartered the right to demand payment of any and all of the outstanding borrowings and other amounts owed under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement at any point in time prior to the maturity date at Standard Chartered’s discretion. Furthermore, the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement grants Standard Chartered a POA to submit a borrowing request to Weichai under the amended Shareholder’s Loan Agreement (see discussion below) if the Company does not submit a borrowing request to Weichai within five business days of receiving a request from Standard Chartered to submit said borrowing request.
In connection with the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company entered into the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement with Weichai. The First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement provides the Company with a $130.0 million secured subordinated loan facility that expires on April 25, 2022. Under the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement, Weichai is obligated to advance funds solely for purposes of repaying outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Uncommitted Revolving Credit Agreement if the Company is unable to repay such borrowings. Any potential borrowings under the First Amended and Restated Shareholder’s Loan Agreement would bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.50% per annum.
See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information for further discussion of the Company’s going concern considerations.
The below schedule of remaining maturities of long-term debt excludes finance leases (refer to Note 7. Leases).
Note 7. Leases
Lease Policies
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease in whole or in part at the inception of the contract. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. All leases with an expected term greater than twelve months result in the recognition of a ROU asset and a liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments unless the implicit rate in the lease is readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is determined considering factors such as the lease term, the Company’s credit standing and the economic environment of the location of the lease.
The lease term includes all non-cancellable periods and may include options to extend (or to not terminate) the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Leases that have a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not result in the recognition of a ROU asset or lease liability.
The Company classifies leases as finance leases when (i) there is a transfer of ownership of the underlying asset by the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for the majority of the remaining economic life of the asset, or (iv) the present value of the lease payments and any residual value guarantee equals or substantially exceeds the fair value of the asset.
Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is generally front-loaded as the finance lease ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis, but interest expense on the lease liability is recognized using the interest method which results in more expense during the early years of the lease. Variable lease payments are expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components, such as fixed maintenance costs, as a single lease component in calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities for all classes of leased assets.
Leases
The Company has obligations under lease arrangements primarily for facilities, equipment and vehicles. These leases have original lease periods expiring between January 2021 and August 2039. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded lease expense of $6.6 million and $6.9 million, respectively, within Cost of sales, $0.7 million for both periods within Research, development and engineering expenses, $0.3 million for both periods within Selling, general and administrative expenses and less than $0.1 million for both periods within Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The following table summarizes the components of lease expense:
The following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to leases:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 6.2 years and 6.7 years for operating leases and 3.8 years and 4.5 years for finance leases, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate was 7.1% and 7.2% for operating leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 6.7% and 6.8% for finance leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to leases:
1. Included in Other noncurrent assets for operating leases and Property, plant and equipment, net for finance leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
2. Included in Other accrued liabilities for operating leases and Current maturities of long-term debt for finance leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
3. Included in Other noncurrent liabilities for operating leases and Long-term debt, net of current maturities for finance leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table presents maturity analysis of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:
Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, a three-level hierarchy of measurements based upon observable and unobservable inputs is used to arrive at fair value. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about valuation based on the best information available in the circumstances. Depending on the inputs, the Company classifies each fair-value measurement as follows:
•Level 1 - based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•Level 2 - based on other significant observable inputs for the assets or liabilities through corroborations with market data at the measurement date; and
•Level 3 - based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Financial Instruments Measured at Carrying Value
Current Assets
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at carrying value, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Debt
The Company measures the Unsecured Senior Notes at original carrying value including accrued interest, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and fees. The fair value of the revolving credit facility approximates carrying value, as it consists of short-term variable rate loans.
The fair value measurement of the Unsecured Senior Notes is defined as Level 3 in the three-level fair value hierarchy, as the inputs to their valuation are not all market observable.
Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
In addition to the methods and assumptions used for the financial instruments discussed above, accounts receivable, net, income tax receivable, and accounts payable and certain accrued expenses are measured at carrying value, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Warrants
The following table summarizes changes in the estimated fair value of the Company’s warrant liability:
* The change in value of the warrant liability is presented in Loss from change in value and exercise of warrants in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in value for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the impact of Weichai exercising the warrant in April 2019.
Note 9. Defined Contribution Plans
As of December 31, 2019, the Company made contributions of $1.1 million to the plans and recorded a liability of $0.5 million for 2019 contributions. During 2020, the Company made contributions of $0.8 million (primarily related to the contribution for 2019). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented certain cost savings measures beginning in April 2020 which included, among other things, the discontinuation of the Company’s 401(k) match through December 31, 2020. The 401(k) match was reimplemented effective January 1, 2021.
Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Contingencies
The legal matters discussed below and others could result in losses, including damages, fines, civil penalties and criminal charges, which could be substantial. The Company records accruals for these contingencies to the extent the Company concludes that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Regarding the matters disclosed below, unless otherwise disclosed, the Company has determined that liabilities associated with these legal matters are reasonably possible; however, unless otherwise stated, the possible loss or range of possible loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Given the nature of the litigation and investigations and the complexities involved, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss for all such matters until the Company knows, among other factors the following:
•what claims, if any, will survive dispositive motion practice;
•the extent of the claims, particularly when damages are not specified or are indeterminate;
•how the discovery process will affect the litigation;
•the settlement posture of the other parties to the litigation; and
•any other factors that may have a material effect on the litigation or investigation.
However, the Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or liquidity in the period in which the amounts are paid.
Securities and Exchange Commission and United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois Investigations
In August 2016, the Chicago Regional Office of the SEC commenced an investigation focused on, among other things, the Company’s financial reporting, misapplication of U.S. GAAP, revenue recognition practices and related conduct, which resulted in the accounting errors giving rise to the financial restatements reported in prior SEC filings. In 2016, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois (the “USAO”) began conducting a parallel investigation regarding these matters. In September 2020, the Company entered into agreements with the SEC and USAO to resolve the investigations into the Company’s past revenue recognition practices. As part of this resolution, the Company made a payment of $1.7 million as a civil penalty to the SEC in October 2020. Furthermore, under the settled administrative order with the SEC, the Company is committed to remediate the deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses identified in its 2017 Form 10-K filed in May 2019 by April 30, 2021 unless an extension is provided by the SEC. The Company also entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (the “NPA”) with the USAO, which contains no further monetary penalty and provides that the USAO will not charge the Company with a crime, provided that the Company complies with the provisions of the NPA, including making enhancements to its corporate compliance program. The Company also will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC and USAO pursuant to these agreements. With these agreements, the investigations into the Company by the SEC and USAO have concluded. The Company had accrued the $1.7 million penalty in Other accrued liabilities in the first quarter of 2019.
Federal Derivative Litigation
In February 2017, Travis Dorvit filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, captioned Dorvit v. Winemaster, et al., No. 1:17-cv-01097 (N.D. Ill.) (the “Dorvit Action”), against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors. The complaint asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment arising from the same matters at issue in the consolidated case captioned Guinta v. Power Solutions International, Inc., No. 1:16-cv-09599 (N.D.Ill.), which had alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), arising from public filings, press releases and conference calls between February 2014 and February 2017, and which was settled in May 2019 (hereinafter, the Giunta Action). In April 2018, Michael Martin filed a second putative stockholder derivative action, captioned Martin v. Winemaster, et al., No. 18-CV-2386 (N.D. Ill.) (the “Martin Action”), in the same court against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors. In July 2018, the court consolidated the Martin Action and the Dorvit Action.
In July 2018, the plaintiffs in the consolidated Dorvit and Martin Actions filed an amended consolidated complaint (the “Second Amended Complaint”) against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors, who are indemnified by the Company as to their legal fees and defense costs. The Second Amended Complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, corporate waste and failure to hold an annual stockholders’ meeting, and it seeks an unspecified amount of damages, an order compelling the Company to hold an annual stockholders’ meeting and an award of costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. In April 2019, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation for approximately $1.9 million (“Settlement Amount”), half of which will be used to pay certain defense costs on behalf of the Company, and the remaining half of which the plaintiffs sought as an award of their attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with the benefit conferred by the settlement. The settlement was approved by the court in August 2019 over two objections, including from the plaintiffs in the McClenney Action (defined below). Plaintiffs in the McClenney Action appealed the court’s order approving the settlement. In February 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s approval of the settlement. The deadline for the plaintiffs in the McClenney Action to seek further review in the U.S. Supreme Court elapsed in July 2020 and the settlement is a final judgement. The Company’s insurers made a payment of half of the Settlement Amount in September 2019 toward the fulfillment of the plaintiff’s award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, and the insurers allocated the remaining half of the Settlement Amount toward the payment of certain defense costs consistent with the terms of the settlement. The Company had accrued for the settlement in Other accrued liabilities and for the full insurance recovery of the Settlement Amount in Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2019.
State Derivative Litigation
In May 2017, Lewis McClenney filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the Chancery Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, captioned McClenney v. Winemaster, et al., No. 2017-CH-06481 (the “McClenney Action”), against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors. The McClenney Action asserted claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste arising from the same matters at issue in the Giunta Action. On the same day that the McClenney Action was filed, Sara Rebscher also filed a putative stockholder derivative action in the same court, captioned Rebscher v. Winemaster, et al., No. 2017-CH-06517 (the “Rebscher Action”). The Rebscher Action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors, arising from the same matters at issue in the Giunta Action. Additionally, the complaint in the Rebscher Action asserts a claim for professional negligence and accounting malpractice against the Company’s former auditor, RSM U.S. LLP (“RSM”). In July 2017, the court consolidated the McClenney Action and the Rebscher Action. Subsequently, the court appointed Rebscher as lead plaintiff and designated the Rebscher Action as the operative complaint. In November 2018, the court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the consolidated case with prejudice on the grounds that it is duplicative of the Dorvit and Martin Actions. Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the court denied in January 2019. In February 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the court’s order dismissing the case. In December 2019, the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the dismissal of the McClenney Action. Plaintiffs did not seek rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court and did not petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.
Jerome Treadwell v. the Company
In October 2018, a putative class-action complaint was filed against the Company and NOVAtime Technology, Inc. (“NOVAtime”) in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. In December 2018, NOVAtime removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division under the Class Action Fairness Act. Plaintiff has since voluntarily dismissed NOVAtime from the lawsuit without prejudice and filed an amended complaint in April 2019. The operative, amended complaint asserts violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”) in connection with employees’ use of the time clock to clock in and clock out using a finger scan and seeks statutory damages, attorneys’ fees, and injunctive and equitable relief. An aggrieved party under BIPA may recover (i) $1,000 per violation if the Company is found to have negligently violated BIPA or (ii) $5,000 per violation if the Company is found to have intentionally or recklessly violated BIPA plus reasonable attorneys’ fees. In May 2019, the Company filed its motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s amended complaint. In December 2019, the court denied the Company’s motion to dismiss. In January 2020, the Company moved for reconsideration of the court’s order denying the motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to stay the case pending the Illinois Appellate Court’s ruling in McDonald v. Symphony Healthcare on a legal question that would be potentially dispositive in this matter. In February 2020, the court denied the Company’s motion for reconsideration, but required the parties to submit additional briefing on the Company’s motion to stay. In April 2020, the Court granted the Company’s motion to stay and stayed the case pending the Illinois Appellate Court’s ruling in McDonald v. Symphony Healthcare. In October 2020, after the McDonald ruling, the court granted the parties’ joint request to continue the stay of the case for 60 days. The court also ordered the parties to schedule a settlement conference with the Magistrate Judge which has been scheduled for early April 2021. The stay remains in place through the scheduled settlement conference. The parties have engaged in preliminary settlement discussions in advance of the settlement conference. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an estimated liability of $0.3 million related to the potential settlement of this matter.
Don Wilkins v. the Company
In April 2017, Don Wilkins, former VP of Advanced Product Development for the Company, filed a two-count complaint alleging breach of contract by the Company and violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collections Act (“IWPCA”) by the Company and its former CEO, Gary Winemaster (the “Wilkins Complaint”). The Wilkins Complaint claims the Company did not have cause to terminate Mr. Wilkins’ Employment and Confidentiality Agreement (the “Wilkins Agreement”), executed January 6, 2012, and that the Company and Mr. Winemaster violated the IWPCA by failing to pay him accrued but unpaid vacation and earned commissions. The Wilkins Complaint seeks damages including a $2.0 million bonus entitlement in the Wilkins Agreement, guaranteed annual salary to increase at 1.5 times the Consumer Price Index per year from the termination date to the end-date of the Wilkins Agreement, December 31, 2020, and 20,000 shares of restricted stock granted to him in 2013 with a vesting schedule through 2020. In June 2017, the Company and Mr. Winemaster answered the complaint and asserted numerous defenses. The Company also asserted counterclaims against Mr. Wilkins including violation of the Illinois Trade Secrets Act, breach of the Wilkins Agreement, breach of fiduciary duty, and spoliation. In January 2019, Wilkins voluntarily dismissed with prejudice his claims for unpaid commissions and vacation against the Company and Mr. Winemaster, subject to the parties’ confidential settlement agreement of those claims. In February 2020, the Company filed a motion for protective order to stay the litigation, which the court denied in April 2020. In May 2020, the parties reached an agreement to settle all remaining claims for a $1.1 million payment (“Wilkins Settlement Amount”) to Mr. Wilkins. The Company paid $0.9 million of the Wilkins Settlement Amount which was reserved as of the first quarter of 2019. The Company’s insurance provider contributed the remainder of the Wilkins Settlement Amount. In June 2020, the court dismissed the Wilkins Complaint with prejudice and with each party to bear their own costs and attorneys’ fees.
Mast Powertrain v. the Company
In February 2020, the Company received a demand for arbitration from Mast Powertrain, LLC (“Mast”) pursuant to a development agreement entered into in November 2011 (the “Development Agreement”). Mast claimed that it is owed more than $9.0 million in past royalties and other damages for products sold by the Company pursuant to the Development Agreement. The Company has disputed Mast’s damages, denied that any royalties are owed to Mast, denied any liability, and counterclaimed for overpayment on invoices paid to Mast. Mast has subsequently clarified its claim for past royalties owed to be approximately $4.5 million. Arbitration is anticipated to occur in the Fall of 2021; however, the Company has engaged in preliminary settlement negotiations with Mast. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had recognized an estimated liability of $1.5 million within Other accrued liabilities related to the potential settlement of this matter.
Indemnification Agreements
Under the Company’s bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, the Company has obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors and certain current and former employees. As a result of cumulative legal fees and settlements previously paid, the Company fully exhausted its primary directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage of $30.0 million during the first quarter of 2020. Additional expenses currently expected to be incurred and that will occur in the future and/or liabilities that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Company’s past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. The Company accrues for such costs as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $7.1 million of costs related to these indemnification obligations. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the impact of these obligations due to the actions ongoing; however, the impact may be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
At the end of June 2020, the Company entered into a new directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy. The insurance policy includes standard exclusions including for any ongoing or pending litigation such as the previously disclosed investigations by the SEC and USAO.
Other Commitments
Letters of Credit
At December 31, 2020, the Company had six outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.3 million. The letters of credit primarily serve as collateral for the Company for certain facility leases and insurance policies. As discussed in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information, the Company had restricted cash of $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 related to these letters of credit.
Supply Agreements
In October 2019, the Company entered into an addendum (the “Addendum”) to a supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”), dated December 11, 2007, with a key supplier. The Addendum extends the Supply Agreement to December 31, 2023 with automatic annual extensions thereafter unless notice of termination is provided. The Addendum extends the Company’s exclusivity for the prescribed territory, but carves out of the restriction the competing engine products supplied by General Motors Company and Weichai. The Company committed to maximize sales and service opportunities on both the key supplier and Weichai engine products, recognizing their different value proposition and target markets. The Addendum also updates the minimum product purchase commitments for the period 2019 through 2023 to $40.0 million per year, subject to reductions based on market declines in oil prices and defined prescribed payments to the key supplier triggered by shortfalls in purchases made by the Company during each annual calendar period. The Company made product purchases of $19.0 million and $47.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Given the significant decline in oil prices in early 2020 and the impact on demand for many of the Companies products, the Company did not meet the minimum purchase commitments for 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued a liability of $0.4 million related to the 2020 purchasing shortfall. Given the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and the global economy, the Company continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of potential future purchase volume reductions.
Note 11. Income Taxes
Income tax (benefit) expense was as follows:
The Company made net cash payments for income taxes of $0.2 million in 2020 while it received net cash refunds for income taxes of $0.3 million in 2019.
A reconciliation between the Company’s effective tax rate on income (loss) before income taxes and the statutory tax rate is as follows:
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a pretax loss of $26.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized pretax income of $8.7 million, which included $1.4 million of permanently excludable loss associated with the change in the valuation and exercise of the Weichai Warrant.
The Company generates R&D tax credits as a result of its R&D activities, which reduce the Company’s effective income tax rate. In general, these credits are general business credits and may be carried forward up to 20 years to be offset against future taxable income.
Significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
The Company’s net deferred tax liability is presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
A valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The guidance on accounting for income taxes provides important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized, including whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient income can reasonably be expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset.
The Company evaluated the need to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. As a result of this evaluation, the Company concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and that a full valuation allowance should be maintained against its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s net deferred tax liability of $0.9 million and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represents the deferred tax liability related to indefinite-lived assets which cannot serve as a source of income for the realization of deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has, on a tax-effected basis, $8.4 million in R&D and state tax credit carryforwards which begin to expire in 2021. The Company has $13.2 million and $6.0 million of federal and state (tax effected, net of federal tax benefit) net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset taxable income in the future. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2037 and 2026, respectively. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and Weichai becoming the owner of 51.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at that time. The Company believes that this constituted an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Consequently, all pre-ownership
change tax attributes are subject to an annual Section 382 limitation. Based on the current estimated annual Section 382 limitation, the Company believes all tax attributes subject to Section 382 will be utilized prior to their expiration dates, if any.
The change in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were as follows:
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount accrued for interest and penalties was not material. The Company reflects the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as Other noncurrent liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts included in “reductions for tax positions of prior years” represent decreases in the unrecognized tax benefits relating to expiration of the statutes during each year shown.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company believes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could decrease by an immaterial amount in 2021 due to lapses in the statute of limitations. Due to the various jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns, it is possible that there could be other significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2021, but the amount cannot be estimated.
With few exceptions, the major jurisdictions subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities and open tax years, stated as the Company’s fiscal years, are as follows:
The Company is currently under federal income tax audit for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Company is currently under Illinois income tax audit for tax years 2013 and 2014.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). Among the changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the CARES Act modified net operating loss carryback rules that were eliminated by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, restored 100% bonus depreciation for qualified improvement property, increased the limit on the deduction for net interest expense and accelerated the time frame for refunds of alternative minimum tax credits. The Company’s ability to carryback the net operating losses to earlier years is expected to result in a tax benefit of $2.2 million. There is no net impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets due to the full valuation allowance.
Note 12. Stockholders’ Equity
Common and Treasury Stock
The changes in shares of Common and Treasury Stock are as follows:
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Preferred stock may be designated into one or more series as determined by the Board. As of December 31, 2020, the Board had authorized two series of Preferred stock. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no shares of Preferred stock outstanding.
Weichai Warrant
On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and Weichai becoming the owner of 51.5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, as of such date. See Note 3. Weichai Transactions for additional information.
Note 13. Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has an incentive compensation plan (the “2012 Plan”), which authorizes the granting of a variety of different types of awards including, but not limited to, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”), Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”), deferred stock and performance units to its executive officers, employees, consultants and Directors. The 2012 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board.
Under the 2012 Plan, 830,925 shares were initially made available for awards, with 700,000 additional shares added to the 2012 Plan in 2013. Forfeited shares are added back to the pool of shares available for future awards.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 408,734 shares available for issuance of future awards. To date, the Company’s granted awards have generally been either RSAs or SARs.
SAR awards entitle the recipients to receive, upon exercise, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of shares for which the SAR is being exercised multiplied by the value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise (determined as provided in the SAR award agreement), less (ii) the number of shares for which the SAR is being exercised multiplied by the applicable exercise price, divided by (iii) the value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise (determined as provided in the SAR award agreement). The exercised SAR is to be settled only in whole shares of Common Stock, and the value of any fractional share of Common Stock is forfeited.
RSA grants represent Common Stock issued subject to forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon satisfaction of specified conditions.
Both SAR awards and RSA grants are time-based awards that generally vest over a 2 to 3-year vesting schedule (except grants to members of the Board which have a 1-year vesting schedule). SAR awards generally have a term of 10 years. Compensation expense for recipients of these time-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period from the date of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur rather than apply an estimated forfeiture rate. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily recorded is Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
RSAs are valued based on the fair value of the common stock at grant date.
For all SAR award assumptions, the Company used rates on the grant date of zero-coupon government bonds with maturities over periods covering the term of the awards. The Company considered the historical volatility of its stock price over a term similar to the expected life of the awards in determining expected volatility. The expected term is the period that the awards granted are expected to remain outstanding. The Company has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock and has no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits:
SAR Awards
The Company granted 50,000 and 9,000 SAR awards in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The assumptions used for determining the fair value of the SARs included the following:
SAR activity consisted of the following:
The total fair value of SARs that vested during 2020 and 2019 was $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to SARs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized was approximately 1.7 years.
Restricted Stock Awards
Restricted stock activity consisted of the following:
The total grant date fair value of restricted stock that vested during 2020 and 2019 was $0.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to RSAs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized was approximately 2.3 years.
Note 14. Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the year. Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding primarily reflect the additional shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of unvested share awards. The treasury stock method has been used to compute diluted earnings (loss) per share for 2020 and 2019.
The Company issued warrants that represent the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, SARs and RSAs, all of which have been evaluated for their potentially dilutive effect under the treasury stock method. See Note 3. Weichai Transactions for additional information on the Weichai Warrants and Note 13. Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the SARs and the RSAs.
The computations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are as follows:
The aggregate number of shares excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations because they would have been anti-dilutive were 0.2 million and 1.4 million shares in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Transactions with Joint Ventures
MAT-PSI Holdings, LLC
In December 2012, the Company and MAT Holdings, Inc. (“MAT”) entered into an agreement to create MAT-PSI Holdings, LLC (“MAT-PSI”), which was intended to be a holding company of its 100% Chinese wholly-owned foreign entity, referred to as Green Power. The Company invested $0.9 million for its 50% share of MAT-PSI, which was formed to manufacture, assemble and supply natural gas, gas and alternative-fueled power systems to Chinese and Asian forklift customers. The venture established a production facility in Dalian and also sourced base engines from a local Chinese factory. As MAT-PSI was not profitable, the venture was closed in 2017; however, the Company had previously been in dispute with Green Power related to the wind up of the joint venture and outstanding receivables. On March 29, 2021, the Company executed a settlement agreement with MAT and Green Power which resolved the dispute. The final settlement agreement did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Doosan-PSI, LLC
In 2015, the Company and Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. (“Doosan”), a subsidiary of Doosan Group, entered into an agreement to form Doosan-PSI, LLC. The Company invested $1.0 million to acquire 50% of the venture, which was formed to operate in the field of developing, designing, testing, manufacturing, assembling, branding, marketing, selling, distributing and providing support for industrial gas engines and all components and materials required for assembly of the gas engines to the global power generation market outside of North America and South Korea. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Doosan and the Company agreed to wind down and dissolve the joint venture. This is expected to be completed in 2021.
Joint Venture Operating Results
The Company’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations included income from these investments of $0.3 million in 2020 related to the Company’s portion of the joint ventures earnings for the year. In 2019, the earnings were $0.7 million. The joint venture operating results are presented in Other income, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as “controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.” The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020, because of the previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria established by the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO Framework”).
As a result of management’s review of the Company’s financial and accounting records and the other work completed by the management team and its advisers, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had material weaknesses relating to certain internal controls. These material weaknesses are summarized below, and remediation efforts completed or underway are outlined in the “Ongoing Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting” section below. These material weaknesses were previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and have been updated, as necessary, to reflect the control environment as of December 31, 2020.
Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, and Monitoring
The Company’s control environment, which is the responsibility of management and is subject to the oversight of the Audit Committee and the Board, establishes the tone of the organization, influences the control consciousness of its officers and employees and is the foundation for all other components of internal control over financial reporting.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not maintain an effective control environment, primarily attributable to the following identified material weaknesses:
Control Environment: The Company was unable to demonstrate that it had maintained a corporate culture that (i) instilled an adequate enterprise-wide attitude of control consciousness supporting the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, (ii) promoted accountability and timely communication across the organization and the Board and (iii) had sufficiently robust processes or focus to identify or address internal control weaknesses. This weakness in the control environment likely contributed to many of the other material weaknesses disclosed herein.
Skillset and Competency: The Company did not have sufficient resources with appropriate levels of information technology (“IT”) knowledge to adequately support the organization including, but not limited to, the design and implementation of robust
IT general controls (“ITGC”) to support internal control over financial reporting, the oversight of the Company’s applications, systems and related training to the IT system user group.
Segregation of Duties: The Company did not maintain effective policies, procedures or controls in aggregate to ensure adequate segregation of duties within its business processes, financial applications and IT systems. Specifically, the Company did not have appropriate controls in place to adequately assess the segregation of job responsibilities and system user access for initiating, authorizing and recording transactions. In addition, the Company did not have adequate mitigating or monitoring controls in place.
Control Activities
As of December 31, 2020, the material weaknesses described above contributed to the control activity level material weaknesses described below:
Revenue Accounting: The Company did not maintain effective policies, procedures or controls to ensure that revenue recognition criteria were met prior to recognizing sales transactions. Specifically, the Company did not do the following:
▪timely or accurately communicate terms of newly entered contracts with customers to the accounting department and
▪perform adequate review and approval controls for recording manual revenue entries, including revenue-related reserves (such as sales allowances).
Reserves and Accruals: The Company did not have sufficiently defined procedures or controls to ensure consistent recognition of accrued liabilities and reserve balances, including, but not limited to, excess and obsolete inventory and warranty reserves.
Period-End Close/Accounting Documentation: The Company did not maintain effective procedures or controls in aggregate over the period-end financial close and reporting process to enable timely reporting of complete and accurate financial information. Specifically, it lacked controls to define financial statement review thresholds, consistently review journal entries prior to posting, review procedures related to taxes and inventory in-transit, and consistently prepare, approve and retain adequate supporting documentation for balance sheet account reconciliations.
Information Technology: The Company’s ITGC framework was not adequately designed and implemented to support the effective operation of internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, ITGCs were not designed to ensure that logical access was appropriately segregated and restricted based on business needs, and controls were not consistently implemented to support timely and effective changes to financial systems and applications. The aggregated IT deficiencies impact each ITGC domain and in-scope application, and the pervasive nature and lack of adequate compensating controls limited management’s ability to rely on the completeness and accuracy of data processed by and reports generated from financial applications.
Data Maintenance: The Company did not have defined procedures or controls, in aggregate, to validate the completeness and accuracy of information maintained, input or edited within master and transaction files, including, but not limited to, customer and vendor master files, employee data files, perpetual inventory records, and stock compensation agreements. Additionally, the Company did not have compensating controls to review and validate the underlying data maintained.
Ongoing Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is committed to the continued implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses. The remediation efforts summarized below, which have been or will be implemented, are intended both to address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance the Company’s overall internal control environment.
Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, and Monitoring
Control Environment:
Since 2017, the Company has either replaced or appointed new Board and Audit Committee members, a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Financial Officer, a Chief Commercial Officer, a Chief Information Officer and a Vice President, Internal Audit. These changes, along with the actions of these individuals and other senior management, have collectively improved the tone of integrity, transparency and support of the Company’s updated Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
The Company has updated its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and has initiated an ongoing training program to help ensure employees understand and comply with the Code. The Company continues to enhance the program to provide extensive communications and training to employees across the entire organization regarding the importance of integrity and accountability.
The Company has established a process to identify and address internal control weaknesses throughout the control environment.
Skillset and Competency:
The Company continues to assess the level of and technical skills in the IT function to support the design and implementation of ITGCs. The IT function has been reorganized under the leadership of a new Chief Information Officer who reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Company has recently hired an IT Security lead and is actively recruiting for certain technical IT positions. The Company has continued to supplement a portion of the IT resources with temporary resources to assist with performing certain technical IT activities and controls.
Segregation of Duties:
•The Company has established standards governing the segregation of incompatible duties across the organization.
•The Company has implemented a technical upgrade to its Enterprise Resource Planning System (“ERP System”) and is redesigning system access roles across the Company to improve the segregation of incompatible duties.
•The Company is designing various processes and controls to adequately segregate job responsibilities and system access throughout the organization and to implement applicable mitigating internal controls.
Control Activities
As part of the overall remediation plan, the Company is designing and implementing review and approval controls over data utilized in various accounting processes. These controls will address the accuracy, timely recording and completeness of data used in the determination of significant accounting estimates, reserves and valuations as well as impacted presentation and disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Revenue Accounting:
•The Company is designing and implementing policies and procedures to ensure that critical inputs affecting the accuracy and timeliness of revenue recognition and related reserves and sales allowances are communicated to the accounting department on a timely basis.
•The Company has established and has begun implementing improved review and approval controls across the Company to ensure that revenue, including that of nonroutine revenue transactions, is recognized consistently in accordance with the terms of the contracts with customers and U.S. GAAP.
•The Company has developed and is in the process of implementing sales transaction review procedures to review certain key transaction attributes.
Reserves and Accruals:
The Company is in the process of enhancing controls over the review and approval of key reserves and accruals, including, warranty reserves, sales allowances and excess and obsolete inventory.
Period-End Close/Accounting Documentation:
•The Company has designed and is implementing procedures and controls over the period-end close process and related documentation including, but not limited to, period-end checklists, review and approval of journal entries, taxes, inventory in-transit, account roll forwards and reconciliations, general-ledger account maintenance and financial statement analysis / thresholds.
Information Technology:
•The Company has reconstructed its ITGC framework to focus on controls that mitigate key financial reporting risks.
•The Company has designed and is implementing controls over access, change management and IT operations to ensure that access rights are restricted to appropriate individuals, and that data integrity is maintained via effective change management controls over system updates and the transfer of data between systems.
•The Company is re-designing its ERP System to further improve and automate ITGC’s as well as other business process application controls.
Data Maintenance:
•The Company is designing and implementing procedures and controls to appropriately identify and assess changes made to data repositories that could significantly impact data integrity and the internal control framework, including, but not limited to, (i) creating centralized, complete and accurate data repositories, (ii) maintaining customer and vendor master files, employee data files, perpetual inventory records, inventory physical and cycle counts, and stock compensation agreements (iii) communicating an enterprise data management policy and record retention policy.
•The Company is developing procedures to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the design and operation of internal controls.
When fully implemented and operational, the Company believes the measures described above will remediate the control deficiencies that have led to the material weaknesses it has identified and will strengthen its internal control over financial reporting. The Company is committed to continuing to improve its internal control processes and it will continue to review its financial reporting controls and procedures. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, it may determine that a need exists to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify certain remediation measures described above.
Conclusion
As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.
In light of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company completed substantive procedures, including extensive temporary manual procedures and other measures as needed, to assist with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by effective internal control over financial reporting. These procedures included, but were not limited to, conducting additional analysis and substantive procedures. The Company also hired additional resources and retained outside consultants with relevant accounting experience, skills and knowledge, working under the Company’s supervision and direction to assist with the account closing and financial statement preparation process. These additional procedures have allowed the Company to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting described above, the consolidated financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As previously disclosed under “Item 9A - Controls and Procedures” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the material weaknesses identified.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has completed remediation of its previously reported Policies and Procedures, Complex and Nonroutine Transactions, and Capitalization material weaknesses:
Policies and Procedures:
▪The Company has issued a revised delegation of authority policy that appoints tiered approvers based upon risk and materiality of the transaction and trained employees on the revised policy.
▪The Company has identified a central repository to maintain all the Company’s policies, is providing training to users and is developing a framework to establish responsibility and accountability for executing and monitoring policies and procedures, including updating policies for new accounting pronouncements and guidance.
▪The Company has issued critical accounting policies, a policy for record retention, and IT policies. Additionally, the Company continues to update and reissue its IT policies and procedures.
▪The Company continues to create a culture of continuous improvement and design a framework for management to proactively and openly self-identify, document, reassess, report and remediate policies, procedures and control issues.
Complex and Nonroutine Transactions:
The Company defined policies, procedures and controls to identify and determine the appropriate accounting treatment for certain complex and nonroutine transactions, including, but not limited to, identification of reporting units and triggering events that could impact the assessment of potential impairments of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill, accounting for debt transactions, purchase accounting for business combinations and lease classification.
Capitalization:
The Company has implemented a policy over fixed assets and capitalization. Considering the materiality of capitalized assets, and continuing control improvements, management has determined that this area no longer constitutes a material weakness.
Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above and the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

1067983_2020.htm,1067983,2020,"Item 1. Business Description
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a large number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.
Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees.
Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 360,000 people worldwide at the end of 2020. Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses establish specific policies and practices for their businesses concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Such policies and practices generally address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment for employees, customers and other business partners, offering competitive compensation to employees, including health insurance and retirement benefits and incentives, providing learning and career development opportunities, and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.
Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses
Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshire’s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty and life, accident and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed approximately 51,000 people at the end of 2020.
In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.
K-1
Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.
U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. For example, the U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, called an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead regulator. U.S. state regulators formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead group wide supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including a group capital calculation tool and various liquidity assessments, that could be imposed on insurance groups in the future.
Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $237 billion at December 31, 2020. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (the “2019 TRIA Reauthorization”). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in 2020, or any calendar year thereafter.
To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses.
K-2
During 2020 and thereafter, in the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2021 for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to approximate $1.4 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year.
The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:
•
in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;
•
some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;
•
the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer's use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;
•
policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;
•
the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;
•
the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary significantly by country; and
•
regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.
Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.
Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in other countries, including Canada, various members of the European Union (“EU”), Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau and Dubai. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments.
On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU (“Brexit”), which resulted in the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the UK leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU following Brexit. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU as a result of Brexit, Berkshire expects to continue to maintain a substantial presence in London.
Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.
GEICO-GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO.
GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states.
K-3
The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 36% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2019, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2019 of approximately 58% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being second largest at approximately 13.8%. Since that data was published, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share may have declined, depending on how the effects of pandemic-related premium credit programs will be reflected in A.M. Best’s measurements. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.
State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations.
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group-The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below.
NICO and certain affiliates (“NICO Primary”) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers.
The Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers’ compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner’s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents.
MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the United States. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions to the international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, delivers liability insurance to other professionals, and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

USLI markets policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
The Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) is a group of five insurance companies that provide workers’ compensation, business owners’, commercial auto, commercial package and homeowners’ products to over 350,000 small and mid-sized businesses. GUARD also offers complementary professional liability and umbrella products nationwide. Policies are offered through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers.

K-4
direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. In October 2019, Berkshire sold its 81% interest in Applied Underwriters, Inc.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group-Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. Reinsurance business is written through National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), domiciled in Nebraska, its subsidiaries and various other insurance subsidiaries wholly owned by Berkshire (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. BHRG also conducts business activities globally in 23 countries.
The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions.
Property/casualty
The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks for clients worldwide.
The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries. The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis.
General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.
In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers.
General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG (“GRAG”), based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in 22 countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435.
Life/health
The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Approximately 35% of the aggregate life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group were in the Asia Pacific compared to 26% in the United States, 22% in Western Europe and 17% throughout the rest of the world.
Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures. BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts.
K-5
Retroactive reinsurance
NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. For instance, an excess contract written in January 2017 provides indemnification for 80% of up to $25 billion in excess of $25 billion retained by the ceding company. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.
The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods.
Periodic payment annuity
BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies, generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing annuity premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities.
Investments of insurance businesses-Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $88 billion at the end of 2015 to approximately $138 billion at the end of 2020. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In four of the past five years, Berkshire’s cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains.
Railroad Business-Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at the end of 2020. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels.
BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December 31, 2020, approximately 37% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 26% from industrial products, 24% from agricultural products and 13% from coal.
K-6
Regulatory Matters
BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Environmental Matters
BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations.
Competition
The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.
Utilities and Energy Businesses-Berkshire Hathaway Energy
Berkshire currently owns 91.1% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”). BHE is a global energy company with subsidiaries that generate, transmit, store, distribute and supply energy. BHE’s locally managed businesses are organized as separate operating units. BHE’s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of four regulated utility companies serving approximately 5.2 million retail customers, five interstate natural gas pipeline companies with approximately 21,300 miles of operated pipeline having a design capacity of approximately 21 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and ownership interests in electricity transmission businesses. BHE’s Great Britain electricity distribution subsidiaries serve about 3.9 million electricity end-users and its electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada serves approximately 85% of Alberta’s population. BHE’s interests also include a diversified portfolio of independent power projects, a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility, the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States, and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. BHE employs approximately 24,000 people in connection with its various operations.

General Matters
PacifiCorp is a regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon, serving electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. The combined service territory’s diverse regional economy ranges from rural, agricultural and mining areas to urban, manufacturing and government service centers. No single segment of the economy dominates the combined service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp’s exposure to economic fluctuations. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp sells electricity on a wholesale basis.
MidAmerican Energy Company (“MEC”) is a regulated electric and natural gas utility company headquartered in Iowa, serving electric and natural gas customers primarily in Iowa and also in portions of Illinois, South Dakota and Nebraska. MEC has a diverse retail customer base consisting of urban and rural residential customers and a variety of commercial and industrial customers. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, MEC sells electricity principally to markets operated by regional transmission organizations and natural gas on a wholesale basis.
NV Energy, Inc. (“NV Energy”) is an energy holding company headquartered in Nevada, primarily consisting of two regulated utility subsidiaries, Nevada Power Company (“Nevada Power”) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (“Sierra Pacific”) (collectively, the “Nevada Utilities”). Nevada Power serves retail electric customers in southern Nevada and Sierra Pacific serves retail electric and natural gas customers in northern Nevada. The Nevada Utilities’ combined service territory’s economy includes gaming, mining, recreation, warehousing, manufacturing and governmental services. In addition to retail sales and natural gas transportation, the Nevada Utilities sell electricity and natural gas on a wholesale basis.
As vertically integrated utilities, BHE’s domestic utilities own approximately 29,000 net megawatts of generation capacity in operation and under construction. The domestic utilities business is subject to seasonal variations principally related to the use of electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating.

Regulatory Matters
PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission and distribution-only services.
Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.
AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.
The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service, (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.
Environmental Matters
BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements.
K-9
Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force November 4, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021.
On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself.
The EPA’s repeal and replacement of the Clean Power Plan is not expected to have a material impact on BHE and its energy subsidiaries. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.
BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, through December 31, 2020, BHE’s cumulative investment in wind, solar, geothermal and biomass generation is approximately $34 billion.

Industrial products
Precision Castparts
Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing, fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries; revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications.
Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines.
PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets.
PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets. PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney).
The majority of PCC’s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. In 2020, delay requests increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary rates. Aircraft build rates have not yet begun to recover in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% since the end of 2019 to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. The restructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 from the low margins experienced earlier in the year and further margin improvements are expected going forward.
PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.
Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.

Labor-intensive cutting, sewing and packaging operations are located in Central America, the Caribbean and Vietnam. For the European market, products are either sourced from third-party contractors in Europe or Asia or sewn in Morocco from textiles internally produced in Morocco.

In 2015, FOL entered into an eight-year agreement with one key supplier to provide the majority of FOL’s yarn. Management currently believes there are readily available alternative sources of raw materials and yarn. However, if relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production could be adversely affected, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on results of operations. Additionally, raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. FOL has secured contracts to purchase cotton, either directly or through the yarn suppliers, to meet a large percentage of its production plans for 2021. FOL’s markets are highly competitive, consisting of many domestic and foreign manufacturers and distributors. Competition is generally based upon product features, quality, customer service and price.

Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
The Berkshire Hathaway Automotive Group, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 104 new vehicle franchises through 81 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 29 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company.
Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 70% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers.
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers.
BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA.
K-20
Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.
BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Item 1A.","Item 1A. Risk Factors
Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.
General Business Risks
Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.
A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.
Cyber security risks
We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.
K-22
Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 90, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 97. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions.
We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.
In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole.
Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.
We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.
Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.
Over ten years ago, we assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under a number of equity index put option contracts, which contain equity price risks. Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2020 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations.
K-23
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.
Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected.
Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.
Risks unique to our regulated businesses
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.
K-24
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses.
The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($120.8 billion at December 31, 2020), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings.
Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.
Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.
BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.
Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.
K-25
Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of March, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Revenues and earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter due to closures of facilities where crowds gather, such as retail stores, restaurants and entertainment venues as well as from public travel restrictions and from closures of certain of our businesses. In each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, several of these businesses experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings as compared to the second quarter.
Our businesses that were deemed essential continued to operate through the pandemic, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses. In response to the effects of the pandemic, our businesses implemented various business continuity plans to protect our employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, such as temporarily closing certain retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers of businesses that were not subject to government mandated closure. Our businesses also implemented practices to protect employees while at work. Such practices included work-from-home, staggered or reduced work schedules, increased cleaning and sanitation of workspaces, providing employee health screenings, eliminating non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings and providing general health reminders intended to lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.
We also took actions in response to the economic losses from reductions in consumer demand for products and services we offer and our temporary inability to produce goods and provide services at certain of our businesses. These actions included employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to help mitigate the economic losses and preserve capital and liquidity. Certain of our businesses undertook and may continue to undertake restructuring activities to resize their operations to better fit expected customer demand. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at all of our numerous and diverse operations will normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $657 million in 2020, $325 million in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $750 million in 2020, $800 million in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2018. Underwriting results in 2020 also reflected the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.
K-33
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Results of Operations (Continued)
After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2020 declined $491 million (8.9%) versus 2019, reflecting lower interest income primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2019 increased 21.4% over 2018, attributable to increases in interest and dividend income.
After-tax earnings of our railroad business decreased 5.8% in 2020 as compared to 2019. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.8% as compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. Earnings in 2020 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined 11.4% versus 2019. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic varied among our manufacturing businesses relative to significance and duration.
Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.0 billion in 2020, $435 million in 2019 and $3.0 billion in 2018. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2020 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate losses of $764 million related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of 2019. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 8.4% in 2019 compared to 2018.
Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018, reflecting mixed operating results with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in 2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs.
Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented included significant gains and losses on our investments in equity securities, including unrealized gains and losses from market price changes on securities we continue to hold. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.
Insurance-Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities - underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the operating results of our insurance businesses.
The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider pre-tax losses in excess of $100 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $120.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
K-34
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance-Underwriting (Continued)
Underwriting results in 2020 of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including estimated provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic in the future may be further affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time.
We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”).
Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).
GEICO
GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
2020 versus 2019
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings for 2020 reflected significant declines in losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to lower claims frequencies from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic offset by the effects of the GEICO Giveback program (see following paragraph) on earned premiums.
Premiums written decreased 3.0% compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020, as well as to any new policies written during the same period. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written in 2020 by approximately $2.9 billion. Premiums earned decreased 1.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, which included reductions of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program.

Insurance-Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
Voluntary auto policies-in-force at the end of 2020 increased approximately 820,000 (4.6%) compared to the end of 2019. The increase reflected a 7.3% decrease in new business sales and a 2.5% decrease in non-renewals and policy cancellations.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program.
Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range).
Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019.
Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program.
2019 versus 2018
Premiums written and earned in 2019 increased 5.5% and 6.6%, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to voluntary auto policies-in-force growth of 6.4%, partially offset by a decrease in average premiums per auto policy. The increase in voluntary auto policies-in-force primarily resulted from an increase in new business sales and a decrease in policies cancelled or not renewed. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 1,068,000 during 2019.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2019 increased 10.1% compared to 2018. The loss ratio in 2019 was 81.3%, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2018, primarily due to increases in average claims severities.
Average claims severities in 2019 were higher versus 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range) and bodily injury coverage (seven to nine percent range). Claims frequencies in 2019 declined compared to 2018 for property damage and collision coverages (two to four percent range) and personal injury protection coverage (one to two percent range) and were relatively unchanged for bodily injury coverage. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net increases of $42 million in 2019 and net of decreases $222 million in 2018 for changes in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events.
Underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $493 million (10.6%) over 2018. GEICO’s underwriting expense ratio in 2019 was 14.5%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2018. The underwriting expense increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising expenses and employee-related costs, which reflected wage and staffing increases.

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers are Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) and National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”). Other BH Primary insurers include U.S. Liability Insurance Company, Central States Indemnity Company and MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), acquired October 1, 2018. A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The increase at BH Specialty was driven by increased casualty business globally and the increase at MedPro Group reflected increases across several product categories. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. The declines in workers’ compensation and commercial auto business written reflected the effects of reduced exposures and premium refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic and volume reductions attributable to increased price competition in the market.
Premiums written increased $1.3 billion (15.0%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to higher volumes from BH Specialty, MedPro Group and GUARD, as well as from the effects of the MLMIC acquisition. These increases were partly offset by lower volume at BHHC and the effect of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.
BH Primary’s combined loss ratios were 74.1% in 2020, 69.1% in 2019 and 64.9% in 2018, which reflected the effects of significant catastrophe events during the year and changes in estimated losses for prior years’ loss events. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $207 million in 2020 (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires) and $190 million in 2018 (Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the wildfires in California). We incurred no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019. Losses in 2020 also included $167 million attributable to the pandemic. Finally, losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $265 million in 2020, $499 million in 2019 and $715 million in 2018 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events.
BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and General Reinsurance Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and General Re Life Corporation (collectively, “General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts predominantly through BHLN.

Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Property/casualty
A summary of property/casualty reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Premiums written in 2020 increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, including a small number of contracts with very large premiums, and increased participations on renewals. Premiums written in 2019 increased $1.0 billion (10.8%) compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations on renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar.
Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.6 billion (35.3%). The loss ratio in 2020 was 81.0%, an increase of 7.2 percentage points over 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 included estimated losses of $964 million attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated losses from significant catastrophe events of $667 million from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also reflected net increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events of $162 million in 2020 primarily attributable to legacy environmental, asbestos and other latent injury claims. Such amount as a percentage of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of 2020 was 0.5%.
BHRG’s loss ratio was 73.8% in 2019 and 77.6% in 2018. Losses in 2019 included approximately $1.0 billion from Typhoons Faxia and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, while losses in 2018 included approximately $1.3 billion from Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and wildfires in California. Losses and loss adjustment expenses also included net decreases of $295 million in 2019 and $469 million in 2018 for prior years’ loss events. Such amounts as percentages of the related net unpaid claim liabilities as of the beginning of the applicable year were 1.0% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2018.
Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $533 million (20.6%) over 2019, and underwriting expenses in 2019 increased $376 million (17.0%) over 2018. The increases reflected the increases in premium volumes and changes in business mix.

Life/health
A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to a reinsurance contract covering U.S. health insurance risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was not renewed for 2021. The remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in the Asian and European life reinsurance markets.
Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims (approximately $275 million) and continuing losses from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions with respect to disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. The ratio of life and health insurance benefits to premiums earned was 83.3% in 2020 and 81.5% in 2019, which is before the effects of the BHLN contract amendment referred to below.
Life/health premiums written in 2019 decreased $467 million (8.6%) compared to 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, BHLN amended a yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract with a major reinsurer. BHLN recorded a reduction in earned premiums on this contract in 2019 of $49 million, while premiums earned in 2018 related to this contract were $954 million. In 2019, premiums earned also included $228 million from a new health reinsurance contract and reflected volume growth in life markets, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar.
Underwriting earnings in 2019 included a one-time gain of $163 million attributable to the BHLN yearly-renewable-term life reinsurance contract amendment. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2019 also included losses from increased disability benefit liabilities in Australia, attributable to higher claims experience and changes to various underlying assumptions increased U.S. long-term care liabilities due to discount rate reductions and changes in other actuarial assumptions, and an increase in life claims in North America, partially offset by increased earnings from other international life business.
Retroactive reinsurance
There were no significant retroactive reinsurance contracts written in 2020. Premiums written were $684 million in 2019 and $517 million in 2018, attributable to a limited number of contracts in each year. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019 and pre-tax gains of $169 million in 2018.
Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $1.1 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $947 million in 2018. Overall, we decreased estimated ultimate liabilities $399 million in 2020 for prior years’ contracts compared to an increase of $378 million in 2019. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such changes produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $230 million in 2020 and pre-tax losses of $125 million in 2019.
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $41.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $42.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Unamortized deferred charge assets related to such reinsurance contracts were $12.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Deferred charge assets will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods through periodic amortization.

Periodic payment annuity
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2020 decreased $297 million (34.4%) compared to 2019, which decreased $293 million (25.3%) from 2018. Periodic payment annuity business is price sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019 compared to pre-tax gains of $93 million in 2018.
Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $550 million in 2020, $509 million in 2019 and $433 million in 2018. These losses primarily derived from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as from the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate was approximately 4.0%.
Variable annuity
Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020 compared to pre-tax earnings of $167 million in 2019 and $34 million in 2018. The results of this business reflect changes in remaining liabilities for underlying guaranteed benefits reinsured, which are affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting results from these contracts can be volatile, reflecting the volatility of securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Insurance-Investment Income
A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).
Interest and other investment income declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and the decline continued throughout 2020, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. We expect such rates, which are historically low, to remain low, negatively affecting our earnings from such investments in 2021. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance-Investment Income (Continued)
Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments.
Interest and other investment income increased $224 million (12.1%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term investments and interest from a term loan with Seritage Growth Properties, partially offset by lower income earned from fixed maturity securities and limited partnership investments. Dividend income increased $873 million (23.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in dividend income was attributable to an overall increase in investment levels, including the investment in Occidental and increased dividends from common stock investments.
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $138 billion at December 31, 2020, $129 billion at December 31, 2019 and $123 billion at December 31, 2018. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings of approximately $838 million in 2020, $417 million in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018, and consequently, the average cost of float for each of those periods was negative.
A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions).
Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions).
U.S. government obligations are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”)
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America, with approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states. BNSF also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF classifies its major railroad business groups by type of product shipped which includes consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. A summary of BNSF’s earnings follows (dollars in millions).
The following table summarizes BNSF’s railroad freight volumes by business group (cars/units in thousands).
2020 versus 2019
Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of the year. Volumes sequentially improved from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.
BNSF is an important component of the national and global supply chain and, as an essential business, has continued to operate throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. The pandemic continues to evolve, and the full extent to which it may impact BNSF's business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity will depend on future developments. We believe BNSF's fundamental business remains strong and it has ample liquidity to continue business operations during this volatile period.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019.
Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which drove lower sand and petroleum products volume, along with reduced steel demand, which drove lower taconite volume.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offsetting adverse impacts of the pandemic, primarily for ethanol and sweeteners shipments.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.
Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019.
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and due to improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses.
2019 versus 2018
Railroad operating revenues were $22.7 billion in 2019, a decline of 1.1% versus 2018. During 2019, BNSF’s revenues reflected a 3.6% comparative increase in average revenue per car/unit and a 4.5% decrease in volume. The increase in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to increased rates per car/unit and a favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 5.6% over 2018. BNSF experienced severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected revenues, expenses and service levels. In addition to the impact of an increase in average revenue per car/unit, earnings in 2019 benefited from a reduction in total operating expenses.

Railroad (“Burlington Northern Santa Fe”) (Continued)
Operating revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting volume decreases and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of truck capacity, as well as lower west coast imports.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a decrease in volume. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes and reduced car loadings, due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019. Increased demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the other decreases in volumes.
Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower volumes and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were attributable to export competition from non-U.S. sources, the impacts of international trade policies and the challenging weather conditions in 2019.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 7.4% in 2019 to $3.7 billion compared to 2018, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit and lower volumes. Volumes were negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, as well as from the effects of lower natural gas prices.
Railroad operating expenses were $14.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of $535 million compared to 2018. Our ratio of operating expenses to railroad operating revenues in 2019 of 64.5% decreased 1.7 percentage points versus 2018. Operating expenses in 2019 reflected lower volume-related costs, lower fuel prices and the effects of cost control initiatives, partially offset by the costs associated with the adverse weather conditions.
Fuel expenses decreased $402 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, lower drayage, lower services expense and higher insurance recoveries. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $82 million compared to 2018, due to lower locomotive and various other costs associated with lower volumes and cost controls. Other expenses, net decreased $221 million compared to 2018. In 2019, other expenses were net of a $120 million curtailment gain from an amendment to the company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans.

2020 versus 2019
PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits.
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins.
MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.
NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from the BHE GT&S acquisition, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.
Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units.

Utilities and Energy (“Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company”) (Continued)
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.
2019 versus 2018
PacifiCorp after-tax earnings were $773 million in 2019, an increase of $34 million compared to 2018, reflecting slightly higher utility margin and higher other income, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $4 million compared to 2018, as a 0.4% increase in retail customer volumes was largely offset by lower wholesale revenue mainly due to lower volumes.
MEC after-tax earnings of $781 million in 2019 increased $112 million as compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increases in electric utility margin, income tax benefits from higher production tax credits and the effects of ratemaking and other income. Electric utility margin in 2019 increased 2% to $1.8 billion, primarily due to higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes of 1.4%, as a 4.0% increase in industrial volumes was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impacts of weather. These earnings increases were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service (net of lower Iowa revenue sharing) and higher net interest expense.
NV Energy after-tax earnings were $365 million in 2019, an increase of $48 million compared to 2018, as lower operating expenses were partly offset by lower electric utility margin. Electric utility margin in 2019 was $1.6 billion, representing a decrease of $58 million (3%) versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.4% decline in retail customer volumes, largely attributable to the impacts of weather, and rate reductions from the impact of the changes in U.S. income tax laws, partially offset by retail customer growth.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting higher distribution revenues and lower operating expenses, which were largely from lower pension settlement losses in 2019, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a strong average U.S. Dollar. Distribution revenues increased $18 million, attributable to higher tariff rates, partly offset by lower distributed units.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $35 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher transportation revenues from generally higher volumes and rates, favorable margins from system balancing activities and a decrease in operating expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation expense from increased spending on capital projects.
Other energy businesses after-tax earnings in 2019 increased $119 million compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind energy projects ($49 million from tax equity investments and $25 million from new and existing projects and activities), higher income from geothermal and natural gas units, largely due to higher generation and favorable margins and lower operating expenses, partly offset by lower earnings at a hydroelectric facility in the Philippines due to lower rainfall. The increase in earnings also reflected the effects of favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink L.P.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage businesses due to increased refinance activity and earnings attributable to recent business acquisitions, partially offset by lower earnings at brokerage businesses, primarily from a decrease in closed units and lower margins.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $155 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings decline was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized in 2018 related to the reduction of accrued repatriation taxes on undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the changes in U.S. income tax laws, higher interest expense and lower earnings from non-regulated energy services.

Industrial products
The industrial products group includes specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International (“CTB”)), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon, Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products (“LSPI”)). Marmon consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, including equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019.
PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. Historically, a significant portion of PCC’s earnings have been dependent on sales related to the aerospace industry. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers. Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. In 2020, PCC’s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2%, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were $650 million, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC has taken aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% since the end of 2019. PCC recorded charges for restructuring and inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Although earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates, the restructuring actions taken contributed to improved margins in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year and further margin improvements are expected in the future. The level of aircraft production is currently expected to slowly increase beginning in the latter half of 2021. However, this is dependent of the timing and extent that COVID-19 infections are lowered on a sustained basis and the return to historical levels of air travel and subsequent demand for aerospace products.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019, due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. Overall, the effects of the pandemic on Lubrizol were more pronounced in the first half of the year, as volumes rebounded significantly in the second half.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire.
Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all sectors, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies sectors. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services sector and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) as compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues, increased restructuring charges and lower interest income. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic.

Industrial products (Continued)
IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions over the past year. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the industrial products group were slightly lower in 2019 than in 2018 and pre-tax earnings declined 3.2% compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 18.4% in 2019 compared to 19.0% in 2018.
PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. In 2019, PCC generated increased sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets. The increase in aerospace sales was tempered due to significant efforts focused on the ramp-up requirements for certain new aerospace programs, such as LEAP, that created manufacturing inefficiencies and slowed production cycles contributing to delays in product deliveries and sales.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting increased sales of aerospace products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the power markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC incurred incremental costs in 2019 to meet required deliveries to customers associated with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace products.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to 2018. The decline reflected lower volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by higher average selling prices which were necessitated by raw material cost increases. Lubrizol’s consolidated volume in 2019 declined 4% from 2018, primarily due to volume decline of 6% in the Additives product lines.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2019 for the fourth quarter and year decreased 50.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018. Earnings in 2019 were significantly impacted by costs and lost business associated with the Rouen fire. Lubrizol’s operating results in 2019 were also negatively affected by lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partly offset by improved material margins.
Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of lower metal prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors benefitted from higher railcar equipment sales, railcar fleet utilization, railcar repair services, intermodal container leasing revenue and improved crane rental demand in the U.S. and Australia.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2019 (1.0%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected the effects of business acquisitions, partly offset by lower gains from business divestitures. Earnings in 2019 also reflected increased earnings in sectors that experienced sales volume increases, which were substantially offset by lower earnings in the Metal Services and certain other sectors, the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and increased interest and other expenses.
IMC’s revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower sales in several regions, including Asia and Europe, mostly offset by increased revenues from recent business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 12.8% in 2019 versus 2018, attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, changes in business mix to lower margin items and the effects of the U.S./China trade disputes.

Building products
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage services, insurance and interest income from lending activities increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, partly attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues of the building products group in 2019 increased $1.65 billion (8.8%) compared to 2018, while pre-tax earnings increased 12.8% over 2018. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.0% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The comparative increase was primarily due to a 26% increase in home sales, reflecting a net increase in units sold and changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 84% in 2019 over 2018, primarily due to business acquisitions, while average prices declined 5%. Manufactured home unit retail sales increased 5% and wholesale sales were 9% lower in 2019. Interest income from lending activities increased 6.7% in 2019 compared to 2018, attributable to increased originations and average outstanding loan balances. Aggregate loan balances outstanding were approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings were $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $182 million (20.0%) compared to 2018. The increase was attributable to home building activities, which benefitted from the increases in home sales, and to financial services activities. Pre-tax earnings from lending and finance activities increased 12%, primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to higher average loan balances, increased earnings from other financial services and lower credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, attributable to higher average borrowings and interest rates, and by higher other operating costs.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were $13.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 2.8% versus 2018. Revenues increased for paint and coatings, hard surface flooring and roofing products, attributable to a combination of increased volumes, product mix changes and increased average selling prices, while sales of brick products declined.

Building products (Continued)
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were $1.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.2% over 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from a combination of increases in selling prices in certain product categories, declining raw material costs for certain commodities and operating cost control initiatives, which were partly offset by the effects of increased facilities closure costs.
Consumer products
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).
2020 versus 2019
Consumer products revenues increased of $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%.
The comparative increase in revenues reflected revenue increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019.
Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility.
The comparative increase in pre-tax earnings was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts.
2019 versus 2018
Consumer products revenues declined $718 million (5.7%) in 2019 versus 2018, driven by a 12.9% revenue decline from Forest River, primarily due to lower unit sales. Revenues of Duracell increased 1.3% and apparel and footwear revenues declined 1.1% compared to 2018. Although revenues from Brooks Sports increased 3.5% in 2019, its operating results were negatively affected by lost sales associated with problems encountered at a distribution center that opened in the second quarter. In addition, our other apparel and other footwear businesses continue to experience lower sales volumes for certain products, reflecting the shift by major retailers towards private label products.
Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $43 million (3.6%) in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to continuing cost containment efforts across several of the businesses and the effects of a new Duracell product launch, partially offset by the impact of lower recreational vehicle sales at Forest River.

Service and retailing
A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).
Service
Our service business group offers shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI), franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen) and offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). Other service businesses include transportation equipment leasing (XTRA) and furniture leasing (CORT), electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and the operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG).
2020 versus 2019
Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020 compared to 12.5% in 2019.
The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline was also attributable to the effects of the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic. Partially offsetting these declines were revenue increases at TTI and at WPLG.
The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and from the effects of the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services.

2019 versus 2018
Service group revenues increased $163 million (1.2%) in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales at TTI and higher aviation-related services revenues (NetJets and FlightSafety), partially offset by decreases from the media businesses and Charter Brokerage. TTI’s sales increased 2% in 2019 compared to the exceptionally high sales levels in 2018. TTI’s sales slowed throughout 2019, attributable to softening customer demand, lower average selling prices and the effects of U.S. trade tariffs. The increase in NetJets’ revenues in 2019 reflected increased lease revenue, primarily attributable to an increase in aircraft on lease, and increased flight hours, partly offset by lower revenue from prepaid flight cards. The revenue decline at Charter Brokerage was attributable to the divesture of a high revenue, low margin business in mid-2019.
Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $155 million (8.4%) compared to 2018. The comparative earnings decline was primarily due to lower earnings from TTI and FlightSafety, partly offset by higher earnings from NetJets. TTI’s earnings decline was primarily attributable to lower gross margins, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses. The earnings decline at FlightSafety was attributable to pre-tax losses of approximately $165 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with an existing government contract, partly offset by lower training equipment impairment charges. Earnings from NetJets increased in 2019, primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved fleet and operating efficiencies, which improved operating margins.
Retailing
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (“BHA”), which consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products and represented 62.6% of our combined retailing revenue in 2020. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics and represented 20.6% of the combined retailing revenues in 2020.
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany.
2020 versus 2019
Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations.
BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6% as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels.
The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened.

Retailing (Continued)
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions, and from lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See’s Candy and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic.
2019 versus 2018
Retailing group revenues increased $385 million (2.5%) in 2019 compared to 2018. BHA’s revenues increased 4.1% in 2019 over 2018, primarily attributable to an 11.5% increase in pre-owned vehicle sales, vehicle pricing increases, improvement in vehicle finance and service contract activities and vehicle repair work as compared to 2018. New vehicle sales in 2019 were relatively unchanged from 2018. Home furnishings group revenues declined 1.3% in 2019 compared to 2018, as sales were relatively unchanged or lower in each of our home furnishings operations.
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $14 million (1.6%) in 2019 over 2018. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 22.7%, primarily due to the increases in earnings from finance and service contract activities, partly offset by higher floorplan interest expense. Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings declined 14.7% versus 2018, reflecting the decline in revenues and generally higher operating expenses.
McLane Company
McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about two-thirds of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2020 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19 related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. McLane continues to operate in an intensely competitive business environment, which is negatively affecting its current operating results. We expect that these operating conditions will continue.
2019 versus 2018
Revenues increased $471 million (0.9%) in 2019 compared to 2018. McLane’s results in 2019 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2018. Otherwise, revenues decreased roughly 3% in the grocery business and increased 3% in the foodservice business in 2019 as compared to 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased $42 million (17.1%) as compared to 2018. The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which was employee costs.

Investment and Derivative Gains (Losses)
A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses follows (dollars in millions).
Investment gains (losses)
We are required to include the unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of investments in equity securities in earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains included net unrealized gains of approximately $55.0 billion in 2020 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at December 31, 2020 and net losses of approximately $14.0 billion from changes in market prices during 2020 on securities sold during 2020. We recorded pre-tax unrealized investment gains of approximately $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices in 2019 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2019. Pre-tax unrealized investment losses of approximately $22.7 billion were recorded in 2018 attributable to market price changes in 2018 on equity securities we held at December 31, 2018. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $6.2 billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $3.3 billion in 2018.
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value.
Derivative gains (losses)
Derivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. Substantially all remaining contracts will expire by February 2023. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was $727 million and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $1.1 billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts.
Equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax losses of $159 million in 2020, pre-tax gains of $1.5 billion in 2019 and pre-tax losses of $300 million in 2018. These gains and losses reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties were relatively insignificant in each of the three years.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Other (Continued)
After-tax equity method earnings (losses) include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia and Electric Transmission of Texas. Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $170 million in 2020 and $488 million in 2019 and our after-tax losses were $1,859 million in 2018. Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $611 million in 2020, $339 million in 2019 and approximately $2.7 billion in 2018.
After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Critical Accounting Policies on page K-63 for additional details.
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s outstanding Euro denominated debt (€6.85 billion par) and Japanese Yen denominated debt (¥625.5 billion par), and BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt (£1.75 billion par). Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The income tax expense adjustments relate to investments that were made between 2015 and 2018 in certain tax equity investment funds. Our investments in these funds aggregated approximately $340 million. In December 2018, we first learned of allegations by federal authorities of fraudulent conduct by the sponsor of these funds. In January 2020, the principals involved in creating the investment funds plead guilty to criminal charges related to the sale of the investments. In the first quarter of 2019, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the previously recognized income tax benefits were not valid.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $443.2 billion, an increase of $18.4 billion since December 31, 2019, which was net of common stock repurchases of $24.7 billion. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $42.5 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $31.7 billion. During each of the last three years, changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our earnings. Our results in 2020 also included after-tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairments charges of $11.0 billion.
At December 31, 2020, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $135.0 billion, which included $112.8 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $301.6 billion.
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was $22.7 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, Berkshire repaid maturing senior notes of €1.0 billion and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. Berkshire also issued ¥195.5 billion of senior notes (approximately $1.8 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of 1.07% and maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060. In the first quarter of 2021, senior notes of $1.7 billion will mature, including $665 million (€550 million) that matured in January. In January 2021, Berkshire issued €600 million of 0.5% senior notes due in 2041.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $18.9 billion at December 31, 2020, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2050 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. Berkshire guarantees the full and timely payment of principal and interest with respect to BHFC’s senior notes. In January 2021, $750 million of BHFC debt matured and BHFC issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051.
Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Capital expenditures of these two operations were $9.8 billion in 2020 and we forecast a similar amount of capital expenditures in 2021.
K-57
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Financial Condition (Continued)
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.2 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $9.6 billion since December 31, 2019. In 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and repaid approximately $3.2 billion of debt. BHE also assumed $5.6 billion in debt in connection with the business acquired from Dominion Energy in November 2020. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program as amended permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. In 2020, Berkshire paid $24.7 billion to repurchase shares of its Class A and B common stock.
Contractual Obligations
We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the financial statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the estimated liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions). Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table.
(1)
Primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2020 follows.
Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions.
As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include liabilities for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.
Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $120.8 billion (including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance), of which 83% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.
GEICO
GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2020, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $22.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $21.8 billion.
GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2020, case development liabilities averaged approximately 33% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.
Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2019 were reduced by $253 million during 2020, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2020 reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.
K-59
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)
With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2020. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $300 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions).
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts and is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR estimates to reinsurers.
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further delay the reporting of claims. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2020, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $800 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:
Paid and incurred loss development methods - these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods - these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.
Frequency and severity methods - these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.
Additional Analysis - in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.
Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.
For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.
In 2020, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $160 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)
For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, the overall change in estimates for prior years’ events was not significant in 2020. However, the potential for significant changes in future periods remains. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts increased $468 million in 2020, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.
Retroactive reinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2020, gross unpaid losses were $41.0 billion and deferred charge assets were $12.4 billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed.
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.
We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020, which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million. In 2020, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Retroactive reinsurance (Continued)
In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2021 will approximate $1.1 billion.
Other Critical Accounting Policies
Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may vary materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020. We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC.
Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of goodwill related to PCC was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers is particularly severe. We considered a number of factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers on reduced aircraft production, and the actions we are taking or may take to restructure our operations to fit lower expected demand. In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide-scale distribution of medicines and vaccines that effectively treat the virus. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments.
As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.

Market Risk Disclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
Equity Price Risk
Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four issuers.
We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates and the remaining duration of the contracts.
The following table summarizes our equity securities and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date.

Interest Rate Risk
We may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in the reported liabilities. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.
The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Foreign Currency Risk
Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way.
Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and service subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses in net earnings related to certain liabilities of Berkshire and U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, due to changes in exchange rates. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions).
Commodity Price Risk
Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
K-67
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses- Refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are $79,854 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others:
•
We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.
•
We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by:
•
Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned premium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
•
Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities.
•
With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
•
We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.
•
We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts are $40,966 million as of December 31, 2020. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2020, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $31 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company performed an interim reevaluation of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at the PCC reporting unit. This determination was made due to disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that had an adverse impact on the industries in which PCC operates. As a result of the reevaluation, the Company recognized goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the amount of approximately $10 billion, as the fair values of the PCC reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their respective carrying values. As a result, PCC reported goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $21 billion as of December 31, 2020.
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results in the respective years.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’ disclosures.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth rates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and discount rate selected by management.

Significant accounting policies and practices
(a)
Nature of operations and basis of consolidation
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 27. Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
(b)
Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in March. COVID-19 has since adversely affected nearly all of our operations, although the effects are varying significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the time necessary to distribute safe and effective vaccines and to vaccinate a significant number of people in the U.S. and throughout the world as well as the long-term effect from the pandemic on the demand for certain of our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.
(c)
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills
Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments (including U.S. Treasury Bills) with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
(d)
Investments in fixed maturity securities
We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of these investments are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method.
We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, as determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. Otherwise, we evaluate as of the balance sheet date whether the unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, along with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.
(e)
Investments in equity securities
We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains/losses.
(f)
Investments under the equity method
We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.
In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.
(g)
Receivables
Receivables primarily consist of balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to claims for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and claim benefits under life and health insurance contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectible balances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms and historical loss history.
As of January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for credit losses. See Note 1(w). In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including, collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.

(h)
Loans and finance receivables
Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all of these loans at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid or fees received along with acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans.
Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured housing installment loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent.
Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.
(i)
Derivatives
We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable.
(j)
Fair value measurements
As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.
(k)
Inventories
Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2020, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 35% of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $950 million as of December 31, 2019.

Property, plant and equipment
We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend useful lives or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements - 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment - 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other - 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway - 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment - 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems - 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets - 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets - 3 to 40 years.
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.
(m)
Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property from others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost. We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance deprecation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is relatively greater during the earlier years of its life and maintenance and repair costs increase during the later years. We also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment.
When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
(o)
Revenue recognition
We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, such premiums are earned ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.
Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.
We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service.
Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue.
Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract.

Revenue recognition (Continued)
Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.
The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments.
Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services, or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training and franchising and news distribution services.
Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases.
(p)
Losses and loss adjustment expenses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value.
We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.
(q)
Retroactive reinsurance contracts
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with other short duration property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Insurance policy acquisition costs
We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability, and we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $3.25 billion and $2.95 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(s)
Life and annuity insurance benefits
We compute liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive and expenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates for most contracts range from 3% to 7%.
(t)
Regulated utilities and energy businesses
Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.
Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers.
(u)
Foreign currency
The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings.
(v)
Income taxes
Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely.

New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. We do not measure an allowance for expected credit losses on accrued interest and instead, as permitted, we elected to reverse uncollectible accrued interest through interest income on a timely basis. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses, which was primarily related to our manufactured housing loans.

New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019
Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. In adopting and applying ASC 842, we elected to use practical expedients, including but not limited to, not reassessing past lease and easement accounting, not separating lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and not recording assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of that date and elected to not restate prior period financial statements.
Upon the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion and lease liabilities of $5.9 billion. We also reduced other assets by approximately $300 million. Consequently, our consolidated assets and liabilities increased by approximately $5.9 billion. ASC 842 did not have a material effect on our accounting for our lessor contracts or for lessee contracts classified as financing leases.

New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2018
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” ASU 2018-02 “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” and ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” Prior year financial statements were not restated. A summary of the effects of the initial adoption of ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASC 606 on our shareholders’ equity follows (in millions).
In adopting ASU 2016-01, as of January 1, 2018, we reclassified the net after-tax unrealized gains on equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Thereafter, the unrealized gains and losses from the changes during the period in the fair values of our equity securities are included within investment gains/losses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In adopting ASU 2018-02, we reclassified certain deferred income tax effects as of January 1, 2018 attributable to the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In adopting ASC 606, we recorded increases to certain assets and other liabilities, with the cumulative net effect recorded to retained earnings.

New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2020
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” ASU 2018-12 requires periodic reassessment of actuarial and discount rate assumptions used to value policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts, with the effects of changes in cash flow assumptions reflected in earnings and the effects of changes in discount rate assumptions reflected in other comprehensive income. Under current GAAP, the actuarial and discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limited circumstances. ASU 2018-12 requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business acquisitions
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.
In July 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) reached a definitive agreement with Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) to acquire substantially all of Dominion’s natural gas transmission and storage business. On October 5, 2020, BHE and Dominion also agreed, as permitted under the acquisition agreement, to provide for the acquisition of all originally agreed upon businesses, except for certain pipeline assets (the “Excluded Assets”) and entered into a second acquisition agreement with respect to the Excluded Assets. The acquisition of the Dominion businesses, other than the Excluded Assets, was completed on November 1, 2020 and included more than 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, about 420 billion cubic feet of operated natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). Under the terms of the second acquisition agreement, BHE agreed to acquire the Excluded Assets for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The closing of this second acquisition is subject to receiving necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during the first half of 2021.
The cost of the acquisition completed on November 1, 2020, was approximately $2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments as provided in the agreement. The preliminary fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill are summarized as follows (in millions).
As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25% economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100% of the general partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary. The noncontrolling interests in the preceding table is attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. The acquisition price was approximately $2.5 billion. As of the acquisition date, the fair value of MLMIC’s assets was approximately $6.1 billion, primarily investments ($5.2 billion), and the fair value of its liabilities was approximately $3.6 billion, primarily unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ($3.2 billion).

On August 8, 2019, Berkshire invested a total of $10 billion in Occidental Corporation (“Occidental”) newly issued Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $62.50 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, on August 3, 2020, the number of shares of common stock that can be purchased was increased to 83.86 million shares and the exercise price was reduced to $59.62 per share. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, or is mandatorily redeemable under certain specified capital return events. Dividends on the preferred stock may be paid in cash or, at Occidental’s option, in shares of Occidental common stock. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the redemption of the preferred stock. Our investments in Occidental are included in the commercial, industrial and other category in the preceding tables.

Equity method investments (Continued)
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $95 million in 2020, $493 million in 2019 and losses of approximately $2.7 billion in 2018. Equity method earnings (losses) included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $850 million in 2020, $450 million in 2019 and $3.7 billion in 2018. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $521 million in each of 2020 and 2019 and $814 million in 2018, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value.
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our investment was approximately $13.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by $2.0 billion (15% of carrying value). In light of this fact, we evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. We utilize no bright-line tests in such evaluations. Based on the available facts and information regarding the operating results of Kraft Heinz, our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery, the relative amount of the decline and the length of time that fair value was less than carrying value, we concluded that recognition of an impairment loss in earnings was not required. However, we will continue to monitor this investment and it is possible that an impairment loss will be recorded in earnings in a future period based on changes in facts and circumstances or intentions.
Summarized financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions).
Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) and Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”). The carrying value of our investments in these entities was approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our equity method earnings in these entities were $631 million in 2020, $683 million in 2019 and $563 million in 2018. Additional information concerning these investments follows.
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A source of funding for Berkadia’s operations is through its issuance of commercial paper, which is currently limited to $1.5 billion. On December 31, 2020, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. The commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy.
A Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company subsidiary owns a 50% interest in ETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint. American Electric Power owns the other 50% interest.
On October 3, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement and an equity purchase agreement whereby we acquired a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America, supplying more than 11 billion gallons of fuel per year via more than 950 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale distribution. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We also entered into an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner of Pilot in 2023.

Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. As a lessee, we primarily lease office and operating facilities, locomotives, freight cars, energy generation facilities and transmission assets. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $5,579 million and lease liabilities were $5,469 million at December 31, 2020. Operating lease right-of-use assets were $5,941 million and lease liabilities were $5,882 million at December 31, 2019. Such amounts were included in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The weighted average term of these leases was approximately 7.3 years at December 31, 2020 and 7.7 years at December 31, 2019. The weighted average discount rate used to measure lease liabilities was approximately 3.6% at December 31, 2020 and 3.8% at December 31, 2019. A summary of our remaining operating lease payments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows (in millions).
Components of operating lease costs for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, by type, are summarized in the following table (in millions). Operating lease expense was $1,649 million in 2018.

Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued)
The gross carrying amounts and related accumulated amortization of other intangible assets are summarized as follows (in millions).
Intangible asset amortization expense was $1,277 million in 2020, $1,317 million in 2019 and $1,393 million in 2018. Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2021 - $1,262; 2022 - $1,190; 2023 - $1,108; 2024 - $986 and 2025 - $906. Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $19.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and primarily related to certain customer relationships and trademarks and trade names.
During 2020, we concluded it was necessary to reevaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believed that the most significant of these disruptions related to the air travel and commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of approximately $10 billion and pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately $10 billion of these charges related to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), the largest business within Berkshire's manufacturing segment. The carrying value of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to the impairment charges was approximately $31 billion.
The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flow methods and reflected our assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from the forecasts.

Derivative contracts
We are party to derivative contracts through certain of our subsidiaries. The most significant derivative contracts consist of equity index put option contracts. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions).
The equity index put option contracts are European style options written prior to March 2008 on four major equity indexes. Notional value in the preceding table represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contract’s expiration date. Intrinsic value is the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Substantially all open contracts as of December 31, 2020 will expire by February 2023.

Derivative contracts (Continued)
Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received aggregate premiums of $1.9 billion on the contract inception dates with respect to unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2020 and we have no counterparty credit risk.
We recorded derivative contract losses of $159 million in 2020, gains of $1,484 million in 2019 and losses of $300 million in 2018, with respect to our equity index put option contracts. These gains and losses were primarily due to changes in the equity index values. These contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates and the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined until the contract expiration dates.
Our regulated utility subsidiaries may use forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options to manage a portion of their commodity price risks. Most of these net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities are probable of recovery through rates and are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 16), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions).
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Current accident year losses included approximately $950 million in 2020, $1.0 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018 from significant catastrophe events occurring in each year. Current accident year losses in 2020 also reflected the effects of low private passenger automobile claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $356 million in 2020, $752 million in 2019 and $1,406 million in 2018, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.5% in 2020, 1.1% in 2019 and 2.4% in 2018.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to primary insurance were reduced by $518 million in 2020, $457 million in 2019 and $937 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 was primarily attributable to reductions for private passenger automobile, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases for other casualty claims. The decrease in 2019 reflected reductions in medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partially offset by higher commercial auto and other liability claims. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to reductions for workers’ compensation, medical professional liability and private passenger automobile claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events related to property and casualty reinsurance increased $162 million in 2020 and were reduced $295 million in 2019 and $469 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 included increased claims estimates for legacy casualty exposures.
Estimated claim liabilities included amounts for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance recoverable, of approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2019. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims.
Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The effects of businesses acquired or disposed during the period are reflected in the data presented on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2020 follows (in millions).
GEICO
GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.
We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated.
Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

GEICO’s incurred and paid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance, are summarized by accident year below for physical damage and auto liability claims. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all policy coverages and excludes projected IBNR claims. Dollars are in millions.

BH Primary
BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional liability and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, including commercial auto and general liability insurance. Incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions.
BH Primary Medical Professional Liability
We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

BH Primary Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty
We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers’ compensation and other casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.
*
Unaudited required supplemental information
BHRG
We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claims liabilities. We use certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.
Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.
Incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year, net of reinsurance. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2020. Dollars are in millions.

Retroactive reinsurance contracts
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims payments may commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, once a contractual retention amount has been reached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).
In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates of the contracts. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or no practical analytical value.
Estimated ultimate claim liabilities included $17.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $18.2 billion at December 31, 2019, with respect to an agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”) to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25 billion of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses in excess of $25 billion retained by AIG for certain commercial insurance loss events occurring prior to 2016. The related deferred charge assets were $5.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2019.

Retroactive reinsurance contracts (Continued)
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $907 million in 2020, $1,188 million in 2019 and $919 million in 2018, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.
Our retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities include estimated liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $12.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.

Notes payable and other borrowings
Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges shown in the following tables are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2020.
In March 2020, Berkshire repaid €1.0 billion of maturing senior notes and issued €1.0 billion of 0.0% senior notes due in 2025. In April 2020, Berkshire issued ¥195.5 billion (approximately $1.8 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2060 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.07%.
Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. During 2020, BHFC repaid $900 million of maturing senior notes and issued $3.0 billion of senior notes consisting of $500 million of 1.85% notes due in 2030, $750 million of 1.45% notes due in 2030 and $1.75 billion of 2.85% notes due in 2050.
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥625.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2020 and pre-tax gains of $192 million in 2019 and $366 million in 2018.

Notes payable and other borrowings (Continued)
In addition to BHFC borrowings, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $1.2 billion of other subsidiary borrowings at December 31, 2020. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.
BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In November 2020, BHE’s subsidiary debt increased $5.6 billion for the debt assumed in connection with the Dominion pipeline business acquisition. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2020, BHE and its subsidiaries also issued new term debt of approximately $7.6 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2062 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2% and repaid $3.2 billion of term debt and reduced short-term borrowings.
BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. During 2020, BNSF issued $575 million of 3.05% senior unsecured debentures due in 2051 and repaid debt of $570 million. As of December 31, 2020, BNSF, BHE and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BNSF, BHE or their subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $9.3 billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included approximately $8.2 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

Income taxes (Continued)
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown below (in millions).
We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support normal business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes.
On December 22, 2017, legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted. Among its provisions, the TCJA reduced the statutory U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and provided for a one-time tax on certain accumulated undistributed post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. These effects were largely recorded in 2017 upon the enactment. In 2018, we reduced our estimate of the income taxes on the deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized additional deferred income tax rate change effects.

Income taxes (Continued)
Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 in the table below (in millions).
We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011 and the tax years 2012 and 2013 remain open. The IRS is auditing Berkshire’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2014 through 2016 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2021. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,113 million and $952 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2020, were $920 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate. We recorded income tax expense of $60 million in 2020 and $377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related to investments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through 2018. We now believe that it is more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. We do not expect any material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2021.

Dividend restrictions - Insurance subsidiaries
Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $23 billion as ordinary dividends during 2021. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2019.
Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $237 billion at December 31, 2020 and $216 billion at December 31, 2019. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.

Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.
Level 1 - Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.
Level 2 - Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.
Level 3 - Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities.

We acquired investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidental common stock warrants in August 2019 at an aggregate cost of $10 billion. We currently consider the related fair value measurements to contain Level 3 inputs. See Note 4 for information regarding these investments.
Quantitative information as of December 31, 2020, with respect to assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions).
Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in the Occidental Preferred and Occidental common stock warrants. These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the Occidental Preferred, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment. The Occidental Preferred is redeemable at Occidental’s option beginning in 2029. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the Occidental Preferred has a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments. In valuing the Occidental common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility of the warrants. The Occidental common stock warrants contractually expire on the one-year anniversary on which no Occidental Preferred remains outstanding.
Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts. We determine the fair value of the equity index put option contract liabilities based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December 31, 2020 are shown in the table below. In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued.
Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equivalent to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 1,624,958 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $20 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Revenues from contracts with customers
We recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.

Pension plans
Certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Benefits under the plans are generally based on years of service and compensation or fixed benefit rates. Plan sponsors may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements and may also make discretionary contributions. The components of our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).
The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBOs of such plans were approximately $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cost of pension plans covering employees of certain regulated subsidiaries of BHE are generally recoverable through the regulated rate making process.
The funded status at year end 2020 and 2019 and reconciliations of the changes in PBOs and plan assets related to BHE’s pension plans and all other pension plans for each of the two years ending December 31, 2020 follow (in millions).

Pension plans (Continued)
The funded status reflected in assets was $1,351 million and in liabilities was $3,842 million at December 31, 2020. The funded status included in assets was $857 million and in liabilities was $3,067 million at December 31, 2019.
The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based on service and compensation prior to the valuation date. The ABO was $19.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $17.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Information for plans with PBOs and ABOs in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows (in millions)
Weighted average assumptions used in determining PBOs and net periodic pension expense follow.
Pension benefit payments expected over the next ten years are as follows (in millions): 2021 - $1,105; 2022 - $1,031; 2023 - $1,034; 2024 - $1,037; 2025 - $1,040; and 2026 to 2030 - $5,119. Sponsoring subsidiaries expect to contribute $202 million to the plans in 2021.
Fair value measurements of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow (in millions).
See Note 20 for a discussion of the three levels of fair value measurements. Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for employer matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Our defined contribution plan expense was approximately $1.4 billion in 2020, $1.2 billion in 2019 and $1.0 billion in 2018.

Contingencies and Commitments
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. As of December 31, 2020, estimated future payments under such arrangements were as follows: $14.6 billion in 2021, $4.5 billion in 2022, $3.4 billion in 2023, $2.8 billion in 2024, $3.1 billion in 2025 and $20.0 billion after 2025. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business.
Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2020, we estimate the cost would have been approximately $6.3 billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners.

Business segment data
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those business activities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accounting adjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts.
Berkshire’s operating segments are as follows.
